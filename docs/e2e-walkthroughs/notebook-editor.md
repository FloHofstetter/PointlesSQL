# Native notebook editor walkthrough

Verifies the Phase-12.6 Monaco-based notebook editor end-to-end —
load + save round-trip, kernel execute, output persistence across
page reload, kernel restart, Pyright LSP (completion + hover),
Variable Explorer, Insert-from-catalog modal, and the retired-
JupyterLab surface.  Replaces the Sprint-23 `notebook.md`
playbook (the embedded JupyterLab iframe retired in Sprint 63).

## Preconditions

- Stack up with the e2e overlay; admin user logged in.
- `notebooks/` is writable by the PointlesSQL process (default
  for both local dev and the Docker overlay).
- soyuz-catalog reachable on :8080 (Insert-from-catalog step
  exercises `/api/tree`).
- **Browser**: Firefox via Playwright-MCP (or the bundled
  `chrome-for-testing` — see `CLAUDE.md` for why the system
  Chrome channel flakes).  Monaco's AMD loader needs modern
  JS; all target browsers are fine.

## Walkthrough

### Part A — First open: UUID mint + autosave

1. **Landing route**.
   - Action: `browser_navigate('http://127.0.0.1:8000/notebook')`
   - Assert: 302 redirect to
     `/notebook/editor?path=scratch.py`, page title contains
     `Editor · scratch.py`, navbar "Notebook" link is active.

2. **Monaco boots + single empty cell**.
   - Action: `browser_wait_for(time=2)` (Monaco AMD loader +
     vendored bundle take ~1 s on a warm cache).
   - Assert: the `.pql-nbedit-editor` div has a Monaco editor
     instance; the buffer contains exactly one `# %%
     pql_cell_id="…"` marker (empty cell scaffold from
     `notebook_editor_page` when the file doesn't exist yet).

3. **Toolbar pills**.
   - Action: `browser_snapshot()` of the `.pql-nbedit-toolbar`.
   - Assert:
     - `Kernel ready` (green) within ~3 s of load — ipykernel
       starts on first WS connect.
     - `Pyright ready` (green) within ~3 s — pyright-langserver
       starts with its Node bundle.
     - `Saved` (green) — the file was just materialised with
       one cell on first save.

4. **First save materialises the file**.
   - Action (shell, adjust path):
     ```bash
     cat notebooks/scratch.py
     ```
   - Assert: a jupytext Percent header is present, followed by
     one `# %% pql_cell_id="<UUID>"` marker and zero source
     lines.  The UUID regex is `[0-9a-fA-F-]{36}`.

### Part B — Execute, outputs, persistence

5. **Type code into the cell**.
   - Action: `browser_click` into the editor area, then
     `browser_type('import pandas as pd\ndf = pd.DataFrame({"a":[1,2,3]})\ndf')`.
   - Assert: the `Saved` pill flips to `Unsaved changes`
     (yellow) on the first keystroke, back to `Saved` 1.5 s
     after the last keystroke (Sprint-58 autosave debounce).

6. **Run the cell (Shift+Enter)**.
   - Action: place cursor inside the cell, press `Shift+Enter`.
   - Assert:
     - A Monaco view zone appears directly beneath the cell.
     - Within ~2 s the view zone contains a pandas-styled HTML
       table (first 3 rows of `df`) — the Sprint-60 rich-mime
       renderer for `text/html`.
     - The "Kernel ready" pill briefly flashes "busy" via the
       internal `executingCells` state; scripted replay can
       skip this check because timing is tight.

7. **Outputs persist across reload**.
   - Action: `browser_navigate` away (e.g. to `/`) and back to
     `/notebook/editor?path=scratch.py`.
   - Assert: before the kernel WS opens, the rendered pandas
     HTML is *already* visible in the output zone — the
     Sprint-60 replay path runs synchronously on Alpine
     mount, so there is no "empty view → output arrives"
     flicker.  The Network panel shows no new kernel execute
     in this interval.

8. **Clear-cell button purges row + DOM**.
   - Action: click `Clear cell`.
   - Assert: the view zone collapses to zero height; reload the
     page — the output zone stays empty (Sprint-60 persistence
     hook deleted the row).

9. **Restart kernel wipes every session row**.
   - Prereq: re-run the cell so there's at least one output.
   - Action: click `Restart`.
   - Assert:
     - Toolbar pill briefly shows `Restarting…` → `Kernel ready`.
     - Every view zone in the editor is empty immediately
       after restart.
     - Reloading the page does not repopulate outputs (the
       Sprint-60 restart path clears all persisted rows for
       the outgoing session).

### Part C — Pyright LSP

10. **Completion on `json.`**.
    - Action: add a new code cell (toolbar `Add cell` button),
      type `import json\njson.` and let the cursor rest
      after the dot.
    - Assert: Monaco's completion widget opens within ~500 ms
      showing at least `dumps`, `loads`, `dump`, `load` in the
      suggestions list.  Each entry's "detail" column carries
      pyright's type signature.

11. **Hover on `json.dumps`**.
    - Action: type `json.dumps(...)` somewhere, hover the
      `dumps` identifier.
    - Assert: Monaco's hover popover opens showing pyright's
      signature (`dumps(obj: Any, *, skipkeys: bool = False, ...) -> str`)
      and the docstring.

12. **Diagnostic on a bad reference**.
    - Action: type `undefinedsymbol_xyz` on a line of its own.
    - Assert: within ~1 s a red squiggle appears under the
      identifier.  Hovering it shows pyright's diagnostic
      message ("undefinedsymbol_xyz" is not defined).

### Part D — Insert from catalog

13. **Open the modal**.
    - Action: press `Ctrl+Shift+I` (or click the `Catalog`
      toolbar button, or invoke the command palette entry
      "PointlesSQL: Insert from catalog…").
    - Assert: the Bootstrap modal overlays the editor; the
      filter input is focused; the list populates within
      ~500 ms from `/api/tree`.

14. **Filter + pick**.
    - Action: type `main` into the filter; click the first
      remaining entry.
    - Assert: modal closes; the editor's cursor line now
      contains `pql.read_table("main.<schema>.<table>")`
      (exact table name depends on the seeded catalog).
    - Assert: Monaco reports no Pyright diagnostic on the
      new line (PQL is importable).

### Part E — Variable Explorer

15. **Open the sidebar**.
    - Action: click the `Variables` toolbar button (or the
      "Toggle variable explorer" command-palette entry).
    - Assert: right-side sidebar expands.  If no user cells
      have run since the last restart, the sidebar shows
      "No user variables yet. Run a cell that defines one."

16. **DataFrame row**.
    - Prereq: run the Part-B cell that defined `df`.
    - Action: observe the sidebar auto-refresh on idle
      (50 ms scheduled debounce per `_handleKernelFrame`).
    - Assert: a row named `df` with type `DataFrame`, shape
      `[3, 1]`, and a 3-row `head()` HTML preview (the
      `.pql-nbedit-vars-df` class is scoped in the template
      so the preview inherits the sidebar styles).

17. **Scalar row**.
    - Action: add a cell `answer = 42`, run it.
    - Assert: sidebar now has an `answer` row with type `int`
      and `repr` `42`.

### Part F — Post-retirement surfaces

18. **No JupyterLab iframe anywhere**.
    - Action: `browser_evaluate(() => document.querySelectorAll('iframe').length)`
      on both `/` and `/jobs/<any-papermill-job>`.
    - Assert: zero iframes matching `src*="lab/"` on the
      home + catalog + jobs pages.

19. **`/api/jupyter/status` is gone**.
    - Action: `fetch('/api/jupyter/status').then(r => r.status)`
    - Assert: `404` (the route was removed in Sprint 63; any
      future re-introduction would need to pass through a
      new route handler).

20. **Sprint-26 output card is single-view**.
    - Action: navigate to `/jobs/<papermill-job>` with a
      completed run.
    - Assert: the output-artifacts card header has no
      `Rendered / JupyterLab` toggle — just the card title +
      run number.  The "Download" button on the run row
      hits `/jobs/{id}/runs/{rid}/notebook/download?format=ipynb`.

21. **Sprint-34 open-in-notebook returns editor_url**.
    - Action: from a UC table detail page, admin-click "Open
      in notebook".
    - Assert: the browser navigates to
      `/notebook/editor?path=scratch/<generated>.py` (not to a
      JupyterLab tree URL).  The scaffolded file contains
      a markdown header cell + a code cell with
      `pql.table("cat.schema.tbl")` + `df.head()` — jupytext
      Percent format with two `pql_cell_id="<UUID>"` markers.

22. **Papermill schedules a `.py` notebook** (optional — needs
    the scheduler overlay).
    - Action: from `/jobs`, create a papermill job with
      `notebook_path: scratch.py`, Run now.
    - Assert: the run transitions running → succeeded; a new
      `notebooks/runs/<run_id>.ipynb` appears on disk; the
      Sprint-63 jupytext-convert temp
      `notebooks/runs/<run_id>.input.ipynb` does **not**
      exist after the run (the `finally` block unlinked it).

## Found bugs

**BUG-69-01** (commit TBD). The first Sprint-69 replay loaded
``markdown-it.min.js`` and ``katex.min.js`` *after*
``monaco/vs/loader.js``.  Both scripts ship UMD wrappers that
detect ``typeof define === 'function' && define.amd`` and register
as anonymous AMD modules — which collides with Monaco's loader
contract ("Can only have one anonymous define call per script
file") and throws the moment KaTeX executes.  Fix: reorder the
three markdown vendor scripts to load *before* ``monaco/vs/
loader.js``, so ``window.define`` does not yet exist when their
UMD wrappers execute and they fall through to the plain-script
branch that binds ``window.markdownit`` / ``window.katex`` as
globals.  The template now documents the ordering rationale in a
Jinja comment so a future refactor does not shuffle the two
blocks by accident.  Caught on the Part-J first-open step during
the mandated Playwright-MCP replay — a clean illustration of
``feedback_run_playbook_as_gate``: neither ruff nor pyright nor
pydoclint nor the reactivity-boundary grep gate could have caught
an AMD vs global loader-order collision.

**BUG-64-01** (commit TBD). The Sprint-58 editor template opened
the root `x-data` attribute with double quotes and pasted the
``{{ notebook_path|tojson }}`` expression straight inside:

```html
<div class="pql-nbedit-root"
     x-data="notebookEditor({ path: {{ notebook_path|tojson }}, ... })">
```

Jinja's ``|tojson`` emits proper JSON (``"scratch.py"``), but
those inner double quotes terminate the outer ``x-data`` HTML
attribute — Alpine then parses only up to the first inner
quote, reports ``expected expression, got '}'``, and every
subsequent ``x-data``-scoped reference ("mount is not defined",
"saveState is not defined", "kernelStatus is not defined")
fires against an empty Alpine scope.  The symptom was a blank
editor page with 25 console errors.

Fixed by switching the outer attribute to single quotes:

```html
<div class="pql-nbedit-root"
     x-data='notebookEditor({ path: {{ notebook_path|tojson }}, ... })'>
```

Single-quoted attribute + double-quoted JSON round-trips cleanly;
the trailing comma before the closing ``})`` was also dropped
(JSON5 tolerance doesn't live inside Alpine's expression parser).
This class of bug escaped every Sprint 58–63 gate because
``ruff`` / ``pyright`` / ``pydoclint`` don't inspect Jinja
templates + Alpine x-data expressions, and the playbook (which
was going to catch it) landed in the same sprint as the bug.
**Lesson**: run the playbook as a gate, not a close-out, when
the sprint touches Alpine scopes.

**BUG-64-02** (commit TBD). After BUG-64-01's x-data fix, Alpine
mounted the editor scope but `mount()` froze on the very first
``monaco.editor.create()`` call when the model used a non-trivial
language (`python`, `javascript`, ...). A plaintext model worked.
The hang was completely silent: no console.error, Firefox at 1 %
CPU, no thrown exception, just `monaco.editor.create()` never
returning.

Root cause: every property of an Alpine ``x-data`` return value
is wrapped in a deep-reactive Vue Proxy. Sprint 58's `mount()`
stored the model on `this._model`, then passed `this._model`
into ``monaco.editor.create({ model: this._model })``. Monaco
read the proxied model's internal properties (uri, version,
tokenization state) — each read returns *another* proxy and
also touches Monaco's own circular references. The recursion
plus reactive tracking on every internal field stalled the
synchronous create call indefinitely.

Standalone repro confirmed Monaco itself is fine: a plain HTML
page that loads vendored Monaco and runs the same
`createModel('print(1)', 'python')` + `editor.create({model})`
returns in ~80 ms. Same code under our Alpine x-data: hangs
forever.

Fix in [frontend/js/notebook_editor.js](../../frontend/js/notebook_editor.js):
hoist `_model` and `_editor` into closure-scoped `let` vars
inside the `notebookEditor()` factory and remove them from the
returned object. All 50-odd in-method `this._editor` /
`this._model` references stay as plain `_editor` / `_model`
identifiers (lexically scoped to the factory closure, never
proxied). The reactive part of the returned object now only
carries primitive UI state (`saveState`, `kernelStatus`, dirty
flag, etc.) — Monaco internals never go through Vue reactivity.

This class of bug also escapes ruff/pyright/pydoclint because
neither the AMD bundle nor the Alpine wrapper is type-checked
at the JS layer. **Lesson**: Monaco / Web Worker / WebSocket
objects must NEVER live as `this.X` inside an Alpine factory —
they belong in closure scope. Add a CodeQL or grep gate in CI
that fails on `this\._(editor|model)\s*=` if we add more
Monaco surfaces.

**BUG-64-03** (commit TBD). With BUG-64-02 fixed, the editor
rendered and both pills (Kernel ready / Pyright ready) flipped
green within 10 s. The first keystroke triggered Sprint-58
autosave → ``POST /api/notebook/doc`` writes ``notebooks/scratch.py``
on disk → uvicorn's dev-mode autoreload watcher saw the file
change and restarted the entire ASGI process → kernel + Pyright
WebSockets dropped → pills went red ("Kernel disconnected",
"Pyright error"). Symptom in the log:

```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:54554 - "POST /api/notebook/doc HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
StatReload detected changes in 'notebooks/scratch.py'. Reloading...
WARNING  pyright-langserver did not stop — killing
INFO     scheduler: stopped
INFO     kernel shut down for demo@pql.test notebook=scratch.py
```

Fix in [pointlessql/api/main.py:cli()](../../pointlessql/api/main.py):
pin uvicorn's reload watcher to the source trees:

```python
project_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
uvicorn.run(..., reload=True,
            reload_dirs=[str(project_root),
                         str(project_root.parent / "frontend")])
```

After the fix, the autosave POST round-trips silently and the
WS connections survive. **Lesson**: when adding a feature that
writes to the working directory in dev, audit ``reload=True``
upstream and explicitly scope ``reload_dirs``.

## What worked on the first try

- Part A (first open + UUID mint + autosave flush) — the
  Sprint-58 + Sprint-58-followup paths compose cleanly without
  a flash of "unsaved" on foreign-notebook open.
- Part B persistence — Sprint-60's replay-on-mount paints
  outputs before the WS handshake completes, so there is no
  visible empty-then-populated flicker.
- Part C completion + hover + diagnostics against `json` and
  an undefined symbol — pyright's bundled Node binary starts
  in ~1 s on a warm cache.
- Part D Insert-from-catalog round-trip — the Ctrl+Shift+I
  binding fires even from inside a focused Monaco instance
  because the command is registered via `editor.addAction`
  rather than a bare document-level hotkey.
- Part F retirement surfaces — the only iframe left in the app
  is the Sprint-26 papermill output viewer (which uses
  nbconvert HTML, not JupyterLab).

## Part G — Sprint 66: per-cell affordances

Phase 12.7 second sprint lifts the editor from a single Python
buffer with global toolbar to a per-cell-affordance UI with a
cell-type registry.  Every cell now has a toolbar row above its
marker (execution count, status pill, elapsed timer, run button)
and a hover-revealed ``+ Code`` / ``+ Markdown`` inserter below
its body.

Setup: open a notebook with at least one code cell and one
markdown cell.

1. **Cell toolbar visible** — each cell shows a ~26px toolbar row
   above its ``# %%`` marker.  Code cells show ``▶ [ ] idle …
   PYTHON``.  Markdown cells show ``markdown … MARKDOWN`` (no run
   button, no ``[n]`` count).

2. **Run a code cell via the per-cell button** — click the ``▶``
   button.  Expect:
   - Count pill flips ``[ ]`` → ``[*]`` on ``execute_input``.
   - Status pill flips ``idle`` → ``running`` (yellow, pulsing)
     on ``status: busy``.
   - Elapsed pill ticks from ``0ms`` upward every 100 ms.
   - On ``execute_reply.status = ok`` the status pill goes
     ``ok`` (green) and the count pill settles on the kernel's
     monotonic counter (``[1]``, ``[2]``, …).

3. **Run a cell that raises** — type ``1 / 0``, run it.  Status
   pill flips to ``error`` (red).  Traceback renders in the
   existing output zone.  Count pill advances; elapsed pill
   freezes at the run duration.

4. **Interrupt a long run** — type ``import time; time.sleep(60)``,
   click ``▶``, then press the toolbar ``Interrupt`` button
   while the status pill is ``running``.  Expect the status pill
   to transition to ``cancelled`` (not ``error``).  Elapsed pill
   shows the time-until-interrupt.

5. **``+`` inserter** — hover between two cells.  The 22px gap
   below each cell reveals two buttons: ``+ Code`` and
   ``+ Markdown``.
   - Click ``+ Code``: a new code cell appears below the anchor
     cell with its own toolbar and a fresh UUID marker.
   - Click ``+ Markdown``: a new markdown cell appears with a
     preview zone immediately below its marker (Sprint 58
     markdown-zone machinery unchanged).

6. **Kernel restart resets counters** — run two code cells so
   their count pills show ``[1]`` and ``[2]``.  Click
   ``Restart``.  Expect all count pills to reset to ``[ ]``, all
   status pills to ``idle``, elapsed pills to clear.

7. **Page reload sanity (BUG-64-02 regression gate)** — start a
   long-running cell, reload the page before it finishes.  Expect
   Monaco to re-hydrate, toolbars to rebuild on each cell, and no
   ``Proxy → circular`` error in DevTools.  (The captured
   ``reactiveRoot`` in the closure prevents per-cell click
   handlers from re-entering a dead Alpine instance.)

### What shipped for Sprint 66

- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js) — registry.
  One descriptor per type (``code``, ``markdown``).  Sprint 71
  adds ``sql`` here without touching any other module.
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js)
  — factory for the toolbar and inserter view zones.  All DOM
  and timer state lives closure-scoped; BUG-64-02 invariant
  preserved.
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_parser.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/cell_parser.js)
  — widened ``CELL_MARKER_RE`` to ``(\s+\[\w+\])?`` so forward-
  compat tags round-trip cleanly.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — ``renderKernelMsg`` now intercepts ``execute_input`` +
  ``execute_reply``; ``runCellById`` is the single execution
  seam; ``insertCellAfter`` drives the inserter.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — CSS additions for ``.pql-nbedit-cell-toolbar``,
  ``.pql-nbedit-status-pill``, ``.pql-nbedit-inserter``.
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](../../scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden list to cover ``this._cellAffordances``,
  ``this._statusWidgets``, ``this._cellWidgets``,
  ``this._reactiveRoot``.

**No backend changes.**  The ``notebook_cell_runs`` schema from
Alembic 017 already reserves the ``execution_count``,
``started_at``, ``finished_at`` columns — Sprint 73 will be the
sprint that actually writes them back from the server.

### What the replay caught

**Alpine-vs-ESM race regression.**  Sprint 65's
``<script type="module" src="bootstrap.js">`` and Alpine's CDN
``<script defer>`` are both deferred; Sprint 66 pushed the module
graph from 9 to 11 modules and the extra two network round-trips
were enough to let Alpine evaluate ``x-data="notebookEditor(...)"``
before ``window.notebookEditor`` existed, leaving the reactive
scope empty (every binding printed a
``ReferenceError: <key> is not defined`` warning).

Fix: converted [bootstrap.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js)
from a module to a classic IIFE that registers the factory
synchronously at parse time and dynamic-imports
[main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js) inside the
factory's ``mount()`` method.  Same shape as the Sprint-41 SQL-
editor mitigation documented in commit ``b830300``.  The script
tag also carries a ``?v=sprint66`` query to bust Firefox's
module-cache entry for consumers upgrading from Sprint 65.

**KeyboardInterrupt is not ``status=aborted``.**  Jupyter surfaces
a user-interrupted cell as ``execute_reply.status='error'`` with
``ename='KeyboardInterrupt'`` — ``status='aborted'`` is reserved
for requests skipped because an earlier request in the same
``execute_reply`` chain failed.  The initial Sprint-66 handler
only remapped ``aborted`` → ``cancelled`` so interrupts showed up
as red ``error`` pills.  Refined the reply handler in
[main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js) to also map
``ename==='KeyboardInterrupt'`` → ``cancelled``.

## Part H — Sprint 67: file-tree sidebar + notebook CRUD

Phase 12.7 third sprint lands a left-side file-tree sidebar inside
the editor so the user can browse, create, rename, and delete
notebooks without leaving Monaco.  The full-screen
``/notebooks/workspace`` page stays as-is; this sidebar is the
slim mirror.

Setup: start with at least two ``.py`` notebooks in the workspace
directory (e.g. ``scratch/one.py`` and ``scratch/two.py``).

1. **Sidebar renders on first open** — navigate to
   ``/notebook/editor?path=scratch/one.py``.  Expect a 260px left
   panel titled ``NOTEBOOKS`` listing every directory + ``.py``
   file under the notebooks root.  The currently-open row
   (``one.py``) has a faint blue tint.  ``.ipynb`` leaves render
   muted — they're listed so the tree stays faithful, but the
   name is not click-to-open from here (the native editor only
   handles ``.py``; open those on ``/notebooks/workspace``
   instead).

2. **Toggle persists** — click ``Files`` in the toolbar.  Sidebar
   collapses.  Reload — sidebar stays collapsed (state written to
   ``localStorage['pql.nbedit.filesVisible']``).  Click again to
   restore; reload again; sidebar stays open.

3. **Open another notebook** — click ``two.py`` in the sidebar.
   Expect a hard navigation to ``/notebook/editor?path=scratch/
   two.py``.  Monaco re-mounts against the new buffer; kernel
   reconnects against the new ``(user_id, path)`` key; the
   sidebar's current-row highlight moves to ``two.py``.

4. **New notebook** — click the ``+`` icon in the sidebar header.
   A Bootstrap modal opens with a path input.  Type
   ``scratch/sprint67-playbook.py`` and hit Enter (or click
   ``Create``).  Expect:
   - ``POST /api/notebooks/create`` returns 200
     ``{"path": "scratch/sprint67-playbook.py", "status": "created"}``.
   - Modal closes, page navigates to the new path.
   - Editor shows one empty code cell.
   - Type ``x = 1`` and wait 1.5 s for autosave.  Refresh the
     sidebar — the new file is now listed.

   Error case: re-open the modal, type the same path again,
   ``Create``.  Expect an inline red alert ``notebook already
   exists at 'scratch/sprint67-playbook.py'`` and the modal
   stays open.

5. **Rename notebook** — hover over ``sprint67-playbook.py`` in
   the sidebar → a pencil icon appears → click it.  Rename modal
   opens with the current path pre-filled.  Change to
   ``scratch/sprint67-playbook-renamed.py`` and click ``Rename``.
   Expect:
   - ``PATCH /api/notebooks/rename`` succeeds.
   - Because the renamed file is the *currently open* one, the
     page hard-reloads at the new URL.
   - Any outputs or run rows from step 4 survive the rename
     (verify: run ``x = 42`` before renaming, then check
     Variable Explorer after reload — ``x`` should still be
     defined server-side after the kernel reconnects, and the
     persisted output row re-plays on the new path because of
     the ``rename_path`` UPDATE in ``notebook_outputs.py``).

   Now rename a *different* file (pencil on ``two.py``) to
   ``two-renamed.py``.  Expect the modal to close and the sidebar
   to refresh in place — no full-page reload, because the
   currently-open notebook was untouched.

6. **Delete notebook** — hover over ``one.py`` → trash icon
   appears → click.  Confirmation modal opens showing the full
   path and the cascade warning.  Click ``Delete``.  Expect:
   - ``DELETE /api/notebooks?path=scratch/one.py`` returns 200.
   - Modal closes; sidebar row disappears.
   - File is gone from disk (verify: ``ls notebooks/scratch/`` has
     no ``one.py``).
   - Any ``notebook_outputs`` rows keyed to that path are purged
     (verify:
     ``sqlite3 pointlessql.db "select count(*) from notebook_outputs where file_path='scratch/one.py'"``
     prints ``0``).

   Try to delete the currently-open file (trash icon on
   ``sprint67-playbook-renamed.py`` after step 5's redirect).
   Expect the icon to be disabled with tooltip ``Close this
   notebook first`` — deleting the open file from underneath the
   editor is a dangling-state hazard we refuse at the UI layer.

### What shipped for Sprint 67

- [pointlessql/services/notebook_workspace.py](../../pointlessql/services/notebook_workspace.py)
  — added ``resolve_notebook_target``, ``create_empty_notebook``,
  ``rename_notebook``, ``delete_notebook``; ``resolve_upload_target``
  now delegates to the shared resolver.
- [pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py](../../pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py)
  — added ``rename_path`` next to ``clear_path`` so rename
  preserves the replay cache.
- [pointlessql/api/main.py](../../pointlessql/api/main.py)
  — ``POST /api/notebooks/create``, ``PATCH /api/notebooks/rename``,
  ``DELETE /api/notebooks?path=…``; all admin-only, all audit-logged.
- [frontend/js/notebook/file_tree.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/file_tree.js)
  — new ESM module exporting ``createFileTreeSlice`` (Alpine
  sub-object) and ``flattenTree`` (pure).  AbortController lives in
  closure scope.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — spreads the file-tree slice into the returned reactive root;
  ``mount()`` fires ``loadTreeInitial()`` alongside the kernel /
  LSP opens.
- [frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js)
  — added matching pre-mount keys + method stubs so Alpine's
  ``x-show`` / ``x-text`` expressions survive the pre-mount window.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — ``<aside class="pql-nbedit-files">`` + Files toggle in the
  toolbar + three Bootstrap modals (new / rename / delete).  CSS
  added for ``.pql-nbedit-files`` and its per-row affordances.
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](../../scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden list to cover ``this._treeFetchCtrl`` /
  ``this._treeAbort``.

**No Alembic migration** — the ``notebook_outputs`` and
``notebook_cell_runs`` schemas from earlier sprints already have
``file_path`` as a plain column, so the rename is a straight
``UPDATE`` and the delete cascade is a straight ``DELETE``.

### What the replay caught

**BUG-67-01 — Alpine x-show vs Bootstrap's ``.modal`` CSS.**  Alpine
3.14.1's ``x-show`` sets ``style.display = ''`` on "show" (empty
string, not the captured inline ``'block'``).  Bootstrap 5's CSS
has ``.modal { display: none }`` with no override for ``.modal.show``
on the container itself (``.show`` only styles ``.modal-dialog``
transforms).  Net effect: the first-time ``false → true``
transition on any ``.modal[x-show="…"]`` in the editor *removes*
the inline ``display: block`` we authored in the template → CSS
cascade kicks in → ``display: none`` from ``.modal`` wins → modal
stays invisible even while Alpine thinks ``newFileOpen=true``.

The pre-existing Catalog-Insert modal (Sprint 62-ish) has the same
latent bug — Ctrl+Shift+I rendered the dimmed overlay but no
modal content.  Not noticed because the Catalog flow was
typically exercised via Playwright-MCP clicks in prior replays,
which fired ``data.catalogInsertOpen = true`` programmatically in
a state where the ``display:block`` was still in place — a red
herring pathway that masked the latent bug until Sprint 67's
replay touched a cold modal.

Fix (applied to all four editor modals in this sprint): replace
``x-show`` with ``:class="{ 'd-block': flag }"``.  Bootstrap's
``.d-block`` utility is ``display: block !important``, which
beats both Alpine's inline manipulation and the ``.modal {
display: none }`` CSS default.  The inline ``style`` attribute
keeps just the backdrop ``background`` colour.  ``x-cloak`` stays
so Alpine-reactive children don't flash on first paint.

Replayed Parts A–H in Firefox after the fix — all four modals
(Catalog, New, Rename, Delete) render and dismiss cleanly; the
six Sprint-67 sidebar flows (render, toggle, open, new, rename-
current-file-hard-reload, delete-other-file-tree-refresh) all
pass.

## Part I — Sprint 68: multi-notebook tab bar

Phase 12.7 fourth sprint adds a tab bar above the editor so the
user can keep several notebooks open in one page and switch
between them without a reload.  Each tab hosts its own Monaco
editor + kernel WS + LSP WS — the Sprint-65 closure-ref factory
is already N-instance-safe, and the Sprint-66 affordance machinery
is editor-scoped (not model-scoped), so swapping tabs is a CSS
``display`` flip, not a Monaco teardown.

Setup: start with two ``.py`` notebooks in the workspace
(e.g. ``scratch.py`` and ``scratch/tab-b.py``).  Clear
``localStorage['pql.nbedit.tabs.v1']`` before each replay so tab
hydration starts from a known state.

1. **Tab bar on first open** — navigate to
   ``/notebook/editor?path=scratch.py``.  Expect:
   - A horizontal tab strip directly below the nav bar with one
     tab labelled ``scratch.py`` (the basename of the URL path).
   - The tab has the "active" visual treatment (filled
     background + a thin bottom border in the Bootstrap primary
     colour).
   - An ``×`` close button appears on hover of the tab.
   - No dirty dot (the file was just saved / just materialised).
   - The Files sidebar toggle lives in the tab-bar's right-side
     area, **not** in the per-tab toolbar (the sidebar is
     shell-scoped, not tab-scoped).

2. **Open a second tab from the sidebar** — with the Files
   sidebar visible, click ``scratch/tab-b.py``.  Expect:
   - No full page reload (the URL in the address bar stays on
     ``?path=scratch.py``, and the network log shows exactly one
     extra request: ``GET /api/notebook/doc?path=scratch/tab-b.py``).
   - A second tab slides in to the right; it becomes active.
   - The first tab's chrome loses the "active" styling but the
     tab itself stays in the strip.
   - The first tab's Monaco editor + kernel WS + LSP WS are
     preserved (confirm: ``monaco.editor.getEditors().length ===
     2`` in the console; ``monaco.editor.getModels().length === 2``;
     neither editor is disposed).

3. **Switch back and forth preserves state** — type
   ``x = 1`` in ``tab-b.py``'s editor, switch to ``scratch.py``,
   type ``y = 2``, switch back to ``tab-b.py``.  Expect:
   - Each tab's cursor position + buffer content is intact.
   - Each tab's toolbar shows its own kernel status + Pyright
     status (both independently ``ready``).
   - The Variable Explorer in each tab is populated from that
     tab's own kernel (``x`` in one tab's panel, ``y`` in the
     other).

4. **Dirty dot on the tab chrome** — type into ``scratch.py``'s
   editor and assert the dirty dot (a small ``•`` in the tab)
   appears within one frame.  Wait 1.5 s for autosave; the dot
   disappears once ``saveState`` flips to ``saved``.  The dot
   reflects the tab's own dirty state, not the active tab's —
   switching away does not hide it.

5. **Close a clean tab** — click the ``×`` on ``scratch/tab-b.py``.
   Expect:
   - No confirmation prompt (the tab is clean).
   - The tab disappears from the strip.
   - The active tab becomes the left neighbour
     (``scratch.py``).
   - ``localStorage['pql.nbedit.tabs.v1']`` now lists only
     ``scratch.py``.
   - The Monaco editor + kernel WS for ``tab-b.py`` are torn
     down (``monaco.editor.getEditors().length === 1``).

6. **Close a dirty tab — confirm modal** — open ``tab-b.py``
   again, type a character to flip it dirty, then click its
   ``×`` before autosave fires.  Expect:
   - A Bootstrap modal opens titled "Unsaved changes" with three
     buttons: Cancel, Discard & close, Save & close.
   - The modal uses the Sprint-67 ``:class="{ 'd-block': flag }"``
     pattern (BUG-67-01); on off→on→off transitions the modal
     stays visible (``x-show`` strips the inline ``display:block``
     and Bootstrap's ``.modal { display: none }`` cascades).
   - ``Cancel`` dismisses the modal and leaves the tab in place.
   - ``Discard & close`` closes the tab without saving.
   - ``Save & close`` flushes ``POST /api/notebook/doc`` first,
     waits for the save to resolve, then closes.  If the save
     errors, the modal stays open and the error toast surfaces
     via the per-tab ``save()`` handler.

7. **localStorage persistence across reload** — with two tabs
   open (``scratch.py`` active, ``tab-b.py`` lazy), reload the
   page.  Expect:
   - Both tabs rehydrate from ``localStorage['pql.nbedit.tabs.v1']``
     + the URL's ``?path=…`` overrides the stored ``active``.
   - The URL-matching tab is mounted eagerly (Monaco + kernel
     up within ~2 s).
   - The non-active tab is present in the strip but **lazy** —
     its inner ``x-if`` stays false, no second Monaco is created,
     no second kernel WS opens.  Verify via
     ``monaco.editor.getEditors().length === 1`` immediately
     post-reload.
   - Click the lazy tab: within ~1.5 s, a second Monaco is
     created, ``GET /api/notebook/doc?path=…`` fires, and the
     tab's kernel/Pyright handshake begins.  Subsequent switches
     back to the eager tab are free (no re-mount).

8. **Kernel sharing for two tabs of the same file** — click
   ``scratch.py`` in the sidebar while ``scratch.py`` is already
   open as a tab.  Expect:
   - ``openTab('scratch.py')`` short-circuits (the path is
     already open) → the existing tab becomes active, no second
     tab added.
   - No extra kernel WS opens because the shell detected the
     duplicate path.
   - This is the frontend counterpart of the kernel registry's
     ``(user_id, path)`` keying (Sprint 63): even if the
     frontend *had* opened a second tab for the same path, the
     server would hand both WS subscribers the same
     ``KernelSession``.  We verify this server-side invariant is
     preserved end-to-end by instrumenting
     ``kernel_registry._sessions`` and asserting exactly one
     ``KernelSession`` exists for a given ``(user_id,
     'scratch.py')`` key across the lifetime of the test.

9. **Rename an open notebook updates the tab chrome** — with
   ``scratch/tab-b.py`` open in a tab, hover its row in the
   sidebar → pencil icon → rename to ``scratch/tab-b-renamed.py``.
   Expect:
   - The sidebar's ``PATCH /api/notebooks/rename`` returns 200.
   - The tab chrome updates in place: label flips to
     ``tab-b-renamed.py``; its DOM tab id stays stable
     (``tab:scratch/tab-b.py`` → ``tab:scratch/tab-b-renamed.py``?
     No — the shell *updates* the tab's ``path`` + ``label``
     but the ``id`` stays the Sprint-68-stable-per-session
     value to keep Monaco + kernel WS alive across the rename).
   - No full-page reload — the Sprint-67 rename-current-file
     hard-reload is replaced by an in-place event (``pql:file-
     renamed``) so Monaco + kernel survive.
   - ``localStorage`` now lists the new path.

10. **Delete an open notebook closes the tab silently** — in the
    sidebar, hover a non-active open tab's row (e.g. the other
    open ``.py``) → the trash icon is **disabled** (tooltip:
    ``Close this notebook in every tab first``).  Click the
    matching tab's ``×`` to close it, then click the row's
    trash.  Confirm delete.  Expect:
    - ``DELETE /api/notebooks?path=…`` returns 200.
    - The sidebar row disappears (tree refresh).
    - If the file had still been open in any tab at the moment
      the sidebar emits ``pql:file-deleted``, the shell silently
      closes the matching tab (no confirm, no toast — the file
      is gone on disk, preserving an orphan tab confuses the
      user).

11. **Tab cap / overflow** — open tabs until the ten-tab cap is
    reached; the eleventh call produces a toast
    ``Tab limit reached (10). Close a tab before opening
    another.`` and the new tab is not added.  With many tabs
    open, the tab strip overflows horizontally with
    ``overflow-x: auto`` — no dropdown overflow menu.

### What shipped for Sprint 68

- [pointlessql/api/main.py](../../pointlessql/api/main.py) —
  new ``GET /api/notebook/doc`` endpoint returning the same
  ``{cells, dirty, outputs}`` bundle the HTML route embeds
  (via shared ``_build_notebook_doc_bundle`` helper).  The
  only backend change in this otherwise frontend-only sprint.
- [frontend/js/notebook/editor_shell.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/editor_shell.js)
  — **new** module: Alpine factory ``createNotebookEditorShell``
  owning the tabs model, activeTabId, close-confirm modal,
  localStorage persistence, and the cross-scope event bus
  (``pql:open-tab`` / ``pql:file-renamed`` / ``pql:file-
  deleted`` / ``pql:tab-state-changed`` / ``pql:save-tab``).
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — renamed ``createNotebookEditor`` → ``createNotebookTabEditor``;
  added ``tabId`` + optional ``initial`` + optional
  ``bundleLoader`` args; moved cell/output initialisation into
  ``mount()`` so lazy tabs bootstrap on first activation; emits
  ``pql:tab-state-changed`` for ``mounted`` / ``dirty`` /
  ``saveState`` transitions so the shell can keep tab chrome
  in sync without polling a proxy.
- [frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js)
  — two factories registered on ``window``:
  ``notebookEditorShell`` (outer scope) and
  ``notebookTabEditor`` (per-tab scope).  Each has its own pre-
  mount stub scope to avoid the BUG-64-02 class of
  pre-mount-warning spam.
- [frontend/js/notebook/file_tree.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/file_tree.js)
  — API reshaped to accept ``getActivePath`` + ``isPathOpenInAnyTab``
  callbacks instead of a static ``currentPath``; navigation-like
  methods (``openNotebook``, ``submitCreateNotebook``,
  ``submitRenameNotebook``, ``submitDeleteNotebook``) dispatch
  CustomEvents on ``document`` instead of calling
  ``window.location.assign``.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — outer ``x-data="notebookEditorShell(...)"`` wrapper; new
  ``.pql-nbedit-tabbar`` above the layout; tab panes via
  ``<template x-for="tab in tabs">`` with inner
  ``x-data="notebookTabEditor(...)"`` scopes and lazy-mount
  ``x-if="tab.mounted || tab.id === activeTabId"``; new
  close-confirm modal (``:class`` gated per BUG-67-01).  Files
  toggle moved from per-tab toolbar to shell-level tab-bar.
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](../../scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden list to cover ``this._tabRefs`` and
  ``this._tabFactories`` so a future temptation to aggregate
  per-tab closure bags onto the shell's Alpine proxy trips CI.

### What the replay caught

**Tab-mounted flag lost during stub→real scope swap.**  The
bootstrap stub seeds ``tabs = [seedTab]`` synchronously with
``mounted: false``.  The template's pre-mount ``x-init="tab.mounted
= true; mount()"`` sets the flag on the seed object, but the
subsequent ``editor_shell.js`` import + ``_hydrateTabs()`` replaces
the tabs array wholesale — the flag is dropped on the floor.
Alpine's ``:key="tab.id"`` diff reuses the DOM element so x-init
does **not** re-fire, leaving ``tab.mounted: false`` on the live
tab.  Net effect: opening a second tab makes the first tab's
``x-if`` (``tab.mounted || active``) evaluate false, Alpine
unmounts the pane, Monaco + kernel are torn down mid-session.

Fix: the per-tab factory fires ``pql:tab-state-changed { mounted:
true }`` **synchronously** at the top of ``mount()``, before any
async Monaco/kernel/LSP work.  The shell's listener updates
``tab.mounted`` in the tabs array.  Discovered during Part I
step 2 replay when a second-tab-open visibly blanked the first
tab — the fix landed in the same sprint before the walkthrough
went green.

## Part J — Sprint 69: markdown-it + KaTeX + pencil pin

Phase 12.7 fifth sprint replaces the Sprint-65 regex markdown
renderer with ``markdown-it`` (CommonMark-conformant — tables,
nested lists, task lists, autolinking), layers KaTeX for
``$…$`` / ``$$…$$`` math via ``markdown-it-texmath``, and adds a
per-cell pencil button that pins a markdown cell into source view
independently of cursor position.  All three libs are vendored under
``frontend/js/vendor/`` via ``scripts/vendor-markdown-libs.sh``
(mirrors the Monaco pattern from ADR 0001); the pencil button is
the first per-cell affordance gated by the Sprint-66 descriptor's
new optional ``affordances`` array.

Setup: run ``bash scripts/vendor-markdown-libs.sh`` once to populate
the three gitignored vendor dirs.  Clear
``localStorage['pql.nbedit.tabs.v1']`` and open
``/notebook/editor?path=scratch.py`` in Firefox (Playwright MCP's
bundled Firefox; the Chrome channel is unsupported per the
Sprint-22 backstory).

1. **markdown-it renders a CommonMark table** — insert a markdown
   cell whose source is:
   ```
   | Catalog | Tables |
   |---|---|
   | bronze | 12 |
   | silver | 7  |
   ```
   Expect: the preview view zone renders a real ``<table>`` with
   borders (styled by ``.pql-nbedit-md-preview table`` in the
   template).  The Sprint-65 regex renderer would have rendered
   this as plain text lines — a regression here means the new
   script tag order is wrong or markdown-it failed to load.

2. **Nested bullet list** — source:
   ```
   - top
     - nested
       - deeper
   ```
   Expect: real nested ``<ul>`` structure with progressive
   indentation.  The Sprint-65 pass only supported one level.

3. **Inline KaTeX math** — source ``Einstein: $E = mc^2$``.
   Expect: ``$E = mc^2$`` renders as a ``<span class="katex">``
   block with the KaTeX-formatted equation (the inline ``c^2``
   shows as a superscript, not a literal ``^2``).  Hovering over
   the KaTeX node shows no browser console warnings.

4. **Block KaTeX math** — source:
   ```
   $$\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}$$
   ```
   Expect: centered block equation with an integral sign, proper
   limits, and a fraction.  The output wraps in a ``<section>``
   (texmath's block marker) and the CSS pins it centered.

5. **Pencil pin — keeps source visible** — hover the markdown
   cell's toolbar; a pencil button appears to the right of the
   cell-type label.  Click it.  Expect:
   - Button icon switches from ``bi-pencil`` (outline) to
     ``bi-pencil-fill`` and gains the warning-coloured
     ``pql-nbedit-pin-btn-active`` treatment.
   - Button title flips to "Unpin (return to preview)".
   - Click into a different cell (code or markdown).  The pinned
     cell's source stays visible — the Sprint-65 auto-hide on
     cursor-leave is suppressed for this cell.

6. **Pencil unpin** — click the pinned cell's pencil again.  Expect:
   - Button reverts to outline ``bi-pencil``.
   - With the cursor still outside the cell, Monaco re-hides the
     source; the preview pane takes over the view zone.

7. **Pin state is session-only** — pin a cell, then hard-reload
   the page (Ctrl+Shift+R).  Expect: every markdown cell opens
   with pencil outline / unpinned.  The flag lives on the in-memory
   ``markdownZones[cellId]`` object; the jupytext marker grammar
   and ADR 0001 are untouched by this sprint.

8. **Cells without ``pin`` affordance have no pencil** — verify
   code cells do not render a pencil button.  Only cell types
   whose registry descriptor includes ``affordances: ['pin']``
   (currently ``markdown`` only) get the button.

9. **KaTeX drop sanity (optional)** — temporarily delete the
   ``<script src="/static/js/vendor/katex/...">`` and the
   ``<script src="/static/js/vendor/markdown-it-texmath/...">``
   tags from ``frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html``
   and hard-reload.  Expect: markdown still renders; ``$E=mc^2$``
   shows as literal dollar-wrapped text.  Revert the template
   edits — this step only exists to prove the drop is
   one-commit-sized for the Phase-12.7 trim policy.

10. **Regression — Sprint-66 / 67 / 68 stay green** — run the
    relevant earlier-sprint steps (toolbar affordances, file tree
    sidebar, tab bar) and confirm no visual regressions.

### What shipped for Sprint 69

- [frontend/js/notebook/markdown.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/markdown.js)
  — full rewrite.  ``renderMarkdown(src)`` now delegates to a
  cached ``markdown-it`` instance (cached in a module-scoped
  ``let mdSingleton`` variable, not on any Alpine proxy) with
  linkify + breaks, layered ``markdown-it-texmath`` when
  ``window.texmath`` + ``window.katex`` are both present.
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js)
  — ``markdown`` descriptor gains ``affordances: ['pin']``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js)
  — pencil button in ``makeToolbarDom`` gated on
  ``descriptor.affordances.includes('pin')``; new exported
  ``setPinState(record, pinned)`` flips the icon + title +
  active class.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — ``handlers.onTogglePin`` owns the in-memory pin flag on
  ``markdownZones[cellId].editModePinned``; ``updateHiddenAreas``
  skips pinned cells; a rebuild re-syncs the pencil state via
  ``setPinState`` so a content edit that rebuilds affordances
  does not desync the button icon.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — KaTeX CSS link, three UMD ``<script>`` tags (markdown-it,
  katex, texmath — KaTeX before texmath so ``.use(window.texmath,
  { engine: window.katex })`` finds its engine), bootstrap.js
  cache bust bumped to ``?v=sprint69``, new CSS for the pencil
  button + markdown-it tables / nested lists / blockquotes /
  KaTeX blocks.
- [scripts/vendor-markdown-libs.sh](../../scripts/vendor-markdown-libs.sh)
  — **new** fetch script mirroring ``vendor-monaco.sh``.  Pins
  markdown-it 14.1.0, markdown-it-texmath 1.0.0, KaTeX 0.16.11
  via env overrides.  Appends a ``window.texmath = texmath``
  line to the vendored texmath.js (ships CommonJS-only).
- [.gitignore](../../.gitignore) — three new vendor dirs.
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](../../scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden list to cover ``this._mdSingleton``,
  ``this._mdPinState``, ``this._pinHandlers`` so a future
  temptation to cache the markdown-it instance or pin-handler
  closures on an Alpine proxy trips CI.  markdown-it carries deep
  rule registries that Alpine's reactive walk would wrap and
  traverse on every re-render — Sprint 69's variant of the
  Sprint-64 / BUG-64-02 class of bug.

### What the replay caught

**BUG-69-01 — UMD vs AMD loader-order collision.**  See the
Found-bugs section at the top of this playbook for the full
write-up.  Caught on the first Part-J open; fixed in the same
sprint by swapping the script-tag order so the three markdown
vendor bundles load before Monaco's AMD loader activates.
The Playwright-MCP replay is what surfaced it — the module
graph boots fine in Node / unit-style probes where no AMD loader
exists at all.

## Part K — Sprint 70: Outline / TOC panel + cell jump

Phase 12.7 sixth sprint bolts on a right-side Outline panel — peer
of the Variable Explorer (same 320px slot, mutually exclusive).
Lists markdown H1/H2/H3 ATX headings (indented per level) and
each code cell's first non-blank stripped line (``# Load …`` stripped
to ``Load …``, truncated to 60 chars with ``…``).  Click an entry
and Monaco jumps to the cell's first content line via
``revealLineInCenter`` + ``focus``.

Extraction is a pure regex over ``cell.source`` — no markdown-it
coupling, which deliberately dodges the Sprint-69 UMD/AMD
loader-order class (BUG-69-01).  The outline renders even if the
markdown vendor bundle fails to load.

### Fixture

Open ``/notebook/editor?path=scratch.py`` in Firefox (Playwright
MCP's bundled Firefox; the system Chrome channel is unsupported
per the Sprint-22 backstory).  The fixture used when replaying
Sprint 70 is four cells:

```
# %% [markdown] pql_cell_id="aaaaaaaa-…"
# Heading 1
## Sub
### Deep

# %% pql_cell_id="bbbbbbbb-…"
import pandas as pd
x = 1

# %% pql_cell_id="cccccccc-…"
# Load customers
df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1,2,3]})

# %% [markdown] pql_cell_id="dddddddd-…"
Just prose here, no headings at all.
```

### Step 1 — Panel mounts empty

1. Confirm the ``Outline`` toolbar button is present between
   ``Variables`` and ``Run cell``, styled ``btn-outline-secondary``
   (outlined).
2. Confirm no right panel is visible.

### Step 2 — Open outline

1. Click ``Outline``.
2. Assert: button flips to ``btn-primary`` (filled).
3. Assert: a 320px right aside appears (``display: block``,
   ``offsetWidth: 320``).
4. Assert: five rows rendered in source order:
    - "Heading 1" (l1 indent, bold)
    - "Sub" (l2 indent)
    - "Deep" (l3 indent, muted)
    - "import pandas as pd" (code row, monospace, muted)
    - "Load customers" (code row — leading ``# `` stripped)
5. The no-heading markdown cell contributes zero rows.

### Step 3 — Click jumps + scrolls + focuses

1. Move Monaco's cursor to line 1 and call
   ``editor.revealLine(1)`` so the target cell is out of view.
2. Click the "import pandas as pd" row.
3. Assert: ``editor.getPosition()`` returns
   ``{lineNumber: <cell body line>, column: 1}``.
4. Assert: ``editor.hasTextFocus() === true`` (``revealLineInCenter``
   + ``focus`` both fired).

### Step 4 — Edit updates outline (debounced 150ms)

1. Insert ``## Newly Added\n`` before the ``## Sub`` line via
   ``model.setValue()``.
2. Wait 250ms (> 150ms debounce).
3. Assert: outline grows to 6 rows; the heading-level sequence
   becomes ``[H1 Heading 1, H2 Newly Added, H2 Sub, H3 Deep]``.
4. ``model.setValue(original)`` to restore and wait another 250ms
   so the on-disk fixture stays clean.

### Step 5 — Mutual exclusion with Variables

1. With Outline open, click ``Variables``.
2. Assert after ~50ms: ``outlineVisible === false``,
   ``variablesVisible === true``; outline aside ``display: none``,
   vars aside ``display: block``.
3. Click ``Outline``.
4. Assert: flags swap again; only the Outline panel is visible.

### Step 6 — Close both

1. Click ``Outline`` again.
2. Assert: ``outlineVisible === false``, ``variablesVisible ===
   false``; Monaco fills the full horizontal room.

### Step 7 — Gated CI still passes

```
bash scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh
```

Expect exit 0 with ``OK — no Alpine-reactive Monaco/Worker/WS/
timer refs in frontend/js/notebook/``.  The Sprint-70 widening
added ``outlineEntries``, ``outlineTimer``, ``outlineDebounce`` to
the forbidden list so a future change cannot regress by parking
the 150ms debounce handle on Alpine's proxy.

### Known quirks (v1)

- **Leading ``#`` stripped from code-cell label.** A first
  non-blank line like ``# Load customers`` becomes "Load
  customers" — intentional, mirrors how Databricks names cells
  via ``# MAGIC`` / ``# COMMAND`` prefixes.  A Python comment
  that happens to start with ``#`` + space will read as the
  cell's name, which is usually what the author wants.
- **Fenced code blocks inside markdown cells are NOT
  fence-aware.**  A line like ``# bash comment`` at column 1
  inside a ```` ```bash ```` fence still regex-matches as H1.
  Accepted for v1; fence tracking would pull markdown-it
  back into the extractor and reopen the BUG-69-01 class.
- **Setext headings (``Heading\n====`` / ``----``) not
  rendered.**  ATX (``#``, ``##``, ``###``) only; H4+ silently
  skipped.

### What the replay caught

**BUG-70-01 — stale closure ``cells`` in debounced recompute.**
First Part-K Step 4 replay flipped the expected outline entries
to the PRE-edit list, not the POST-edit one.  Root cause: the
initial wiring called ``buildOutline(cells)`` with the
closure-scoped ``cells`` array, which is only refreshed on save
path + ``rescanDecorations()``.  Free-form typing inside a cell
never refreshes it, so the 150ms debounce was reading stale
data.  Fix in the same commit: ``recomputeOutline()`` re-splits
from the live Monaco model (``splitCells(model.getValue())``)
with a fallback to ``cells`` when ``refs.get('model')`` is null
(mount-time before Monaco creates the model).  See
[frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
``recomputeOutline`` near the ``scheduleAutosave`` block.

**BUG-70-02 — over-stripping jupytext prefix double-shifted
headings.**  First regex pass stripped a leading ``# `` from
each markdown line to mirror Sprint 69's ``rebuildMarkdownZones``
unwrap.  That turned ``## Sub`` → ``# Sub`` (level 1) and
``### Deep`` → ``## Deep`` (level 2) — every heading's level
shifted down by one.  Root cause: the server's notebook_doc
load path already strips the jupytext ``# `` comment-prefix
before sending the bundle; Monaco's model and
``/api/notebook/doc`` both return raw, unwrapped markdown.  Fix
in the same commit: removed the client-side strip from
[frontend/js/notebook/outline.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/outline.js).

### Files changed (Sprint 70)

- [frontend/js/notebook/outline.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/outline.js)
  — **new**, pure ``buildOutline(cells)`` regex extractor.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — closure-scoped ``outlineEntries`` + 150ms debounce timer;
  reactive ``this.outline`` assigned fresh slice on change;
  ``toggleOutline`` (mutex with ``toggleVariables``);
  ``jumpToCell(cellId)`` reusing ``findCellMarkerLine``;
  recompute re-splits from the live Monaco model to sidestep
  the stale-closure-``cells`` trap.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — ``Outline`` toolbar button; right-side ``<aside class
  ="pql-nbedit-outline">`` mirroring the Variables aside;
  inline CSS for per-level indent classes.
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](../../scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden pattern to cover
  ``this._outlineEntries``, ``this._outlineTimer``,
  ``this._outlineDebounce``.

## Part L — Sprint 71: SQL cell (DuckDB via PQL.sql)

**Preconditions.**

- A seeded 3-part table the test admin can ``SELECT`` from.
  In a fresh dev stack ``main.default.demo`` is the canonical
  fixture; if absent, register one via the SQL editor or the
  ``/admin`` seeders before running the playbook.
- ``scratch.py`` open in [/notebook/editor](../../) — a Code
  cell at top is fine; the SQL cell goes below.

**L1 — ``+ SQL`` inserter shows up.**  Hover the cell-bottom
inserter zone and assert a ``+ SQL`` button appears next to
``+ Code`` and ``+ Markdown``.  ``mcp__playwright__browser_click``
on it.  A new cell with ``pql-nbedit-cell-band-sql`` band class,
toolbar label ``SQL``, ``▶`` run button, and a
``pql-nbedit-result-var`` input mounts.  Marker line on disk
should read ``# %% [sql] pql_cell_id="<uuid>"`` with no
``result_var=`` segment yet.

**L2 — Type SELECT.**  ``mcp__playwright__browser_type`` into
the cell:

```
SELECT * FROM main.default.demo LIMIT 5
```

Saved pill cycles ``Unsaved`` → ``Saved`` after the autosave
debounce.

**L3 — Set ``result_var``.**  Click the ``pql-nbedit-result-var``
input, ``mcp__playwright__browser_type`` ``demo_df``.  Wait at
least 400 ms for the 300 ms debounce + the autosave debounce.
Read the raw file: marker line should now read
``# %% [sql] pql_cell_id="<uuid>" result_var="demo_df"``.
Fields with non-identifier characters (e.g. ``df!``) flip the
input's border to ``--bs-danger`` via
``pql-nbedit-result-var-error`` and do **not** mutate the marker
until the user fixes the input.

**L4 — Run SQL cell.**  Click the ``▶`` button or press
``Shift+Enter``.  Status pill flips ``idle`` → ``running``
within ~50 ms; flips to ``ok`` within ~3 s.  Output zone
contains a pandas-styled HTML table with the LIMIT-5 rows
(``pql-nbedit-output-html`` wrapper).

**L5 — Reference ``result_var`` from a Python cell.**  Insert a
``+ Code`` cell below the SQL cell, type ``demo_df.shape``, run
with ``Shift+Enter``.  Output zone shows ``(5, N)`` where N is
the column count of ``main.default.demo``.

**L6 — Variable Explorer.**  Toggle the right-side Variables
panel.  ``demo_df`` appears with type ``pandas.DataFrame``,
shape ``[5, N]``, ``head()``-rendered preview HTML.

**L7 — Round-trip stability.**  Hard-reload the editor
(``mcp__playwright__browser_navigate`` to the same URL).  SQL
cell + ``result_var`` input + output zone all restore from the
on-disk file + ``notebook_outputs`` replay.  ``demo_df`` is
**not** in the kernel namespace until the cell runs again — the
DataFrame lives in the kernel process which restarts on browser
reload's WS reconnect (kernel session is kept across reloads,
but globals only persist within a kernel session).

**L8 — Drop ``result_var`` segment.**  Clear the
``pql-nbedit-result-var`` input.  Wait the debounce.  Marker
line drops the ``result_var="..."`` segment and reads
``# %% [sql] pql_cell_id="<uuid>"`` again.  Re-run the SQL cell
— output still renders inline; Variables panel does **not**
display ``demo_df`` (no binding).

**L9 — Privilege denial path.**  As a non-admin user (or with
``SELECT`` revoked on ``main.default.demo``), run an L4-style
SQL cell against the table.  Expected: the output zone shows an
``error`` mime with ``ename=AuthorizationError`` and the
soyuz-catalog denial message — the kernel never executes the
query, so no ``[*]`` running indicator and no DataFrame binding.

### Files changed (Sprint 71)

- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js)
  — registered ``sql`` descriptor with ``markerTag: ' [sql]'``,
  ``canExecute: true``, ``bandClass: 'pql-nbedit-cell-band-sql'``,
  ``affordances: ['result_var']``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_parser.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/cell_parser.js)
  — widened ``CELL_MARKER_RE`` to capture optional
  ``result_var="<ident>"`` (group 3); ``splitCells`` /
  ``joinCells`` round-trip the field; ``RESULT_VAR_RE`` exported
  for the affordance validator.
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js)
  — ``result_var`` input + 300 ms debounce + ``RESULT_VAR_RE``
  validator with ``pql-nbedit-result-var-error`` CSS class;
  ``+ SQL`` inserter button next to ``+ Code`` / ``+ Markdown``;
  ``removeAffordances`` clears the debounce on cell teardown.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — ``runCellById`` branches on ``typeId === 'sql'`` and emits
  the ``execute_sql`` WS frame; ``runAllCells`` / ``runCellsAbove``
  share the new ``sendCellFrame`` helper; ``cellResultVarById``
  reads the marker; ``applyResultVarToMarker`` writes back via
  ``editor.executeEdits`` so on-disk text stays the source of
  truth.
- [pointlessql/api/main.py](../../pointlessql/api/main.py)
  — new ``execute_sql`` WS branch that re-uses the
  ``/api/sql/execute`` parse + privilege-check loop via the
  shared ``_resolve_sql_approved_tables`` helper; refactored
  ``_wipe_cell_for_new_execute`` so ``execute`` and
  ``execute_sql`` share the persistence prelude.
- [pointlessql/services/kernel_session.py](../../pointlessql/services/kernel_session.py)
  — ``_NOTEBOOK_BOOTSTRAP_CODE`` defines ``__pql_sql_run`` in
  the kernel; ``_run_bootstrap`` runs it silently between
  ``wait_for_ready`` and the pump tasks (with a
  ``_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT`` safety net); ``restart`` re-queues the
  bootstrap via the regular execute path under reserved cell_id
  ``__pql_sql_bootstrap__`` so ``_is_internal_cell`` skips
  persistence.

### What the replay caught

**BUG-71-01 — pandas got the column-spec dicts as the column index.**
The first ``__pql_sql_run`` definition passed ``res.columns``
straight to ``pd.DataFrame(...)``, but ``SQLResult.columns`` is
``list[dict[str, str]]`` (each entry has ``name`` + ``type``).  The
DataFrame still constructed, but ``DataFrame.__repr__`` raised
``TypeError`` when ``display(df)`` triggered the text/plain fallback
— the cell emitted both an ``html`` mime (which rendered fine) and
an ``error`` mime (which painted the cell red).  Status pill read
``ok`` because ``execute_reply.status`` only watches the cell's top-
level result, not displays mid-flight.  Fix in the same commit:
extract the bare names via ``[c.get("name") if isinstance(c, dict)
else c for c in res.columns]`` before constructing the DataFrame.
Caught at the L4 step on the first replay.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — ``.pql-nbedit-cell-band-sql`` band hue + ``.pql-nbedit-result-var``
  input styling.
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](../../scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden pattern to cover ``this._resultVarTimers``
  / ``this._sqlBootstrap``.

## Part M — Sprint 72: ipywidgets minimal placeholder

**Preconditions.**

- ``ipywidgets>=8.1`` is in the resolved environment (added to
  ``pyproject.toml`` as part of this sprint; ``uv sync`` after
  pulling).
- Fresh kernel — restart it via the toolbar after the dependency
  bump so the kernel subprocess inherits the new ``sys.path``.
- ``scratch.py`` open in [/notebook/editor](../../).

**M1 — Synthetic widget bundle renders the placeholder card.**
Insert a Code cell, type:

```python
from IPython.display import display
display({'application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json':
         {'model_id': 'abc12345xyz9876', 'version_major': 2,
          'version_minor': 0}}, raw=True)
```

Run.  Assert: status pill flips ``running`` → ``ok``; output zone
contains a ``.pql-nbedit-output-widget-placeholder`` card showing
``model_id: abc12345…`` and the disclaimer ``Interactive widgets
will render in a future release. Install widgets in the kernel to
see live updates here.``  No ``error`` mime; no console errors.

**M2 — Real ``ipywidgets.IntSlider``.**  Insert a Code cell:

```python
import ipywidgets as w
w.IntSlider(value=42, min=0, max=100)
```

Run.  Assert: status pill flips ``ok``; output zone shows the
placeholder card with the kernel-emitted widget ``model_id``.
Behind the scenes the kernel emits ``execute_result`` with BOTH
``application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json`` and ``text/plain``
("IntSlider(value=42)"); the renderer's new branch picks the
widget bundle over the text fallback so users do not see the bare
repr leak through.

**M3 — Comm frames silently swallowed.**  Run:

```python
slider = w.IntSlider()
slider.observe(lambda c: print(c))
slider
```

Assert: placeholder card renders for the slider; no client-side
crash; **DevTools console shows no ``comm_open`` / ``comm_msg`` /
``comm_close`` entries** — the WS forwards them as before but the
client's ``renderKernelMsg`` swallows them (a single
``IntSlider()`` instantiation emits dozens; logging would flood
DevTools and obscure real errors).  ``slider.observe(...)``'s
callback never fires because no real widget-manager round-trip
exists yet — this is expected; the placeholder text says so.

**M4 — Missing-``model_id`` fallback.**  Send a malformed widget
bundle:

```python
display({'application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json': {}}, raw=True)
```

Assert: output zone shows a placeholder card whose text is exactly
``Widget output (unrenderable)`` (no model_id, no disclaimer).

**M5 — Persistence + replay.**  Hard-reload the editor.  Assert:
the M1 / M2 / M4 placeholder cards rebuild from
``notebook_outputs`` rows — the widget bundle survives the
serialise / deserialise round-trip because Sprint 60's
``mime_bundle`` column stores the raw ``data`` dict verbatim.

### What the replay caught

**BUG-72-01 — ES module disk cache hides new mime branches in
PointlesSQL until you hard-reload.**  The notebook editor's
[bootstrap.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js) carries a
``?v=sprintNN`` query param so its own ``<script>`` invalidates,
but the modules it dynamically imports
([editor_shell.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/editor_shell.js) +
[main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js) + the eight
siblings, including [output_renderer.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/output_renderer.js))
do **not** carry a version param, so the browser keeps the
previous deploy's modules in disk cache even after the bootstrap
script bumps.  Verified via
``import('/static/js/notebook/output_renderer.js?_t=' + Date.now())``
in DevTools — the cache-busted URL pulled the new code, while the
unversioned import in the editor page still resolved to the old
function body.  Workaround for this sprint: bumped the
bootstrap.js version to ``?v=sprint72`` and noted this in the
playbook so reviewers know to hard-reload (``Ctrl+Shift+R``) when
testing.  Permanent fix is a follow-on sprint that threads a
build-time version stamp into every dynamic import URL — out of
scope here.

### Files changed (Sprint 72)

- [pyproject.toml](../../pyproject.toml) — added
  ``ipywidgets>=8.1`` dependency.  ``uv lock`` resolved
  ``ipywidgets-8.1.8`` + ``jupyterlab-widgets-3.0.16`` +
  ``widgetsnbextension-4.0.15``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/output_renderer.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/output_renderer.js)
  — new high-priority MIME branch in ``renderMimeBundle`` for
  ``application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json`` (must come BEFORE
  ``text/html`` so the widget bundle wins over the fallback
  ``text/plain`` repr).
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — silent swallow of ``comm_open`` / ``comm_msg`` / ``comm_close``
  in ``renderKernelMsg``.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — ``.pql-nbedit-output-widget-placeholder`` + ``.pql-nbedit-widget-model-id``
  + ``.pql-nbedit-widget-note`` styles; bootstrap script version
  bumped to ``sprint72``.

**No Alembic migration.** Trim-safe — the placeholder branch is
the upgrade seam a future sprint will replace with a real
widget-manager.

## Part N — Sprint 73: per-cell run history + diff

**Preconditions.**

- Alembic 018 applied (``uv run alembic upgrade head`` after pull;
  verify with ``uv run alembic check``).
- ``scripts/vendor-diff-lib.sh`` has been run so
  ``frontend/js/vendor/jsdiff/diff.min.js`` exists (the script tag
  in [notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  references it as a vendored UMD bundle).
- ``scratch.py`` open in [/notebook/editor](../../).

**N1 — History button mounts on every executable cell.**  Hover any
code cell's toolbar.  Assert: a clock-icon
``.pql-nbedit-history-btn`` appears next to the run button on every
``code`` and ``sql`` (Sprint 71) cell — and **not** on markdown
cells (markdown is ``canExecute: false``, so no run-history row
ever lands for it).

**N2 — Two runs of the same cell stack into the popover.**  Pick
a code cell, run it (status pill ``ok``), edit the body to a
different value, run again (status pill ``ok`` with a higher
``execution_count`` pill).  Click the History button.  Assert:
popover header reads ``Last 2 runs``; both rows show timestamp
+ duration + status pill + ``[N]`` execution-count pill, both
carry a ``view diff`` button + a ``re-run`` button.  Newest-first
ordering — the first row's stamp is later than the second's.

**N3 — Diff renders source-vs-current.**  Edit the cell again so
the live Monaco buffer differs from both historical snapshots.
Open the popover, click ``view diff`` on the first (newest) row.
Assert: an inline jsdiff-rendered ``.pql-nbedit-diff`` table
appears under the row header with three classes of rows —
``.pql-nbedit-diff-ctx`` (unchanged context lines, sign ``" "``),
``.pql-nbedit-diff-del`` (lines only in the historical source,
sign ``"-"``), ``.pql-nbedit-diff-add`` (lines only in the live
buffer, sign ``"+"``).  Click ``hide diff`` (button text flips):
the table collapses; click again, it re-renders.

**N4 — Re-run replays the historical source without touching
Monaco.**  In the popover, click the ``re-run`` button on the
older row.  Assert: popover closes; cell's status pill flips to
``running`` then back to ``ok``; **the Monaco buffer is unchanged**
(your N3 edits remain on screen); a fresh history row lands at
the TOP of the popover on the next open with the historical
source as its ``source`` column.  Variable Explorer reflects the
historical version's side effects (e.g. ``x`` = the old value).

**N5 — Identical-source diff message.**  Edit the cell back to
match a historical source verbatim.  Open popover, click ``view
diff`` on the matching row.  Assert: ``(sources are identical)``
text instead of an empty table.

**N6 — File-delete cascades into the history table.**  Sidebar
``Delete`` action on a notebook → assert ``notebook_cell_run_sources``
rows for that file_path are gone (cascade-via-service in
``clear_path``).  File-rename: rows re-key onto the new path
(cascade-via-service in ``rename_path``); pre-rename runs
survive in the popover after reload.

**N7 — Persistence across kernel restart.**  Note the popover row
count.  Restart the kernel.  Open the popover again.  Assert:
**all prior runs are still visible** — the history table is the
audit trail and explicitly survives kernel restarts (only file-
level operations cascade).  ``clear_session`` does NOT touch the
history table.

**N8 — Per-cell clear-outputs preserves history.**  Run a cell,
clear its outputs (``Clear`` palette command), open popover.
Assert: history rows still listed — ``clear_cell`` deletes
``notebook_outputs`` + the ``notebook_cell_runs`` upsert row, but
explicitly does NOT touch ``notebook_cell_run_sources`` (the
audit trail is what we want to PRESERVE across re-runs).

### What the replay caught

**BUG-73-01 — ``clear_cell`` cascade was wiping history on every
re-run.**  The first version of the
[notebook_outputs.py](../../pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py)
service threaded ``NotebookCellRunSource`` deletes through the
``clear_cell`` cascade alongside ``NotebookOutput`` and
``NotebookCellRun``.  But ``clear_cell`` is called from
``_wipe_cell_for_new_execute`` at the top of every execute_request
to wipe the previous run's outputs from the persistence cache —
threading the history table into that path meant every re-run
deleted the prior run's row before the new ``record_cell_run_start``
inserted its own.  Result: only the most-recent run ever existed
in the table; popover header always read ``Last 1 run``.  Caught
at the N2 step on the first replay (DB query showed exactly one
row even after three runs).  Fix in the same commit: removed the
``NotebookCellRunSource`` delete from ``clear_cell`` AND
``clear_session``; cascade now lives only in ``clear_path`` (file
delete) and ``rename_path`` (file rename).  ``notebook_cell_runs``
still cascades on ``clear_cell`` because that table holds
"current state per session", not history.

### Files changed (Sprint 73)

- [pointlessql/alembic/versions/018_notebook_cell_run_sources.py](../../pointlessql/alembic/versions/018_notebook_cell_run_sources.py)
  — new migration creating ``notebook_cell_run_sources`` with
  autoincrement id PK, ``ix_notebook_cell_run_sources_path_cell``
  on ``(file_path, cell_id, started_at)``.  No FK to
  ``notebook_cell_runs`` — link is logical, cascade via service.
- [pointlessql/models.py](../../pointlessql/models.py)
  — new ``NotebookCellRunSource`` ORM model mirroring the migration.
- [pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py](../../pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py)
  — ``record_cell_run_start`` (insert + return id),
  ``record_cell_run_finish`` (stamp status + finish + execution
  count by id), ``list_cell_run_sources`` (newest-first read with
  ISO timestamps).  ``clear_path`` + ``rename_path`` extended;
  ``clear_cell`` + ``clear_session`` deliberately NOT extended
  (BUG-73-01 fix).
- [pointlessql/api/main.py](../../pointlessql/api/main.py)
  — ``pending_run_sources`` map keyed by ``(cell_id,
  kernel_session_id)``; ``_wipe_cell_for_new_execute`` calls
  ``record_cell_run_start`` and stashes the returned id;
  ``_handle_shell_lifecycle`` pops the id on ``execute_reply`` and
  calls ``record_cell_run_finish``.  New
  ``GET /api/notebook/cell-runs?path=…&cell_id=…&limit=…`` admin-
  gated route.  ``pending_run_sources`` cleared on kernel restart
  + on dropped reply on a fresh start for the same key.
- [frontend/js/notebook/run_history.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/run_history.js)
  — new module.  Closure-scoped ``_historyCache``, ``_popoverEl``,
  ``_inflightAbort``.  ``openPopover`` fetches
  ``/api/notebook/cell-runs``, renders newest-first with
  ``view diff`` (jsdiff-based ``.pql-nbedit-diff`` table, cap at
  10000 input lines) + ``re-run`` (sends historical source via
  ``execute`` WS frame, does NOT touch Monaco).
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js)
  — clock-icon ``.pql-nbedit-history-btn`` mounted on every
  ``canExecute`` cell; ``handlers.onShowHistory(cellId, anchorEl)``
  callback plumbed through ``mountAffordances``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — ``openHistoryPopover(cellId, anchorEl)`` reads current source
  via ``cellSourceById`` for diffing, threads ``onRerun`` →
  ``sendKernelFrame({type:'execute', ...})`` (NOT
  ``execute_sql``, since SQL history rows hold the wrapped
  ``__pql_sql_run(...)`` snippet — re-running it executes the
  same SQL the kernel saw without re-walking privilege checks).
- [scripts/vendor-diff-lib.sh](../../scripts/vendor-diff-lib.sh)
  — new vendoring script for jsdiff 5.2.0 (npm ``diff``, MIT,
  ~10 KB UMD ``window.Diff``).  Mirrors
  ``vendor-markdown-libs.sh`` shape.
- [.gitignore](../../.gitignore)
  — added ``frontend/js/vendor/jsdiff/`` (mirrors the markdown-it
  / KaTeX gitignore entries).
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — ``<script src="/static/js/vendor/jsdiff/diff.min.js?v=sprint73">``
  tag; bootstrap.js bumped to ``?v=sprint73``;
  ``.pql-nbedit-history-btn`` /
  ``.pql-nbedit-history-popover`` / ``.pql-nbedit-diff`` styles.
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](../../scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden pattern to cover ``this._historyCache`` /
  ``this._historyPopover`` / ``this._historyAbort``.

**Trim-safe.** Sprint 74 (theme + keymap + phase close) does not
import the run-history module; revert is sprint-local.

## Part O — Sprint 74: settings drawer + keymap overlay + phase close

**Preconditions.**

- ``scratch.py`` open in [/notebook/editor](../../) on a fresh
  profile (localStorage empty so defaults apply).
- Hard-reload the page if upgrading from a pre-sprint-74 deploy —
  the bootstrap.js version was bumped to ``?v=sprint74``.

**O1 — Toolbar buttons mount.**  Inspect the toolbar.  Assert: a
gear icon button (``i.bi-gear``) and a question-mark icon
(``i.bi-question-circle``) sit between the ``Outline`` toggle and
the ``Run cell`` button.  Both have hover tooltips; clicking them
opens the drawer / overlay singletons lazy-mounted to ``<body>``
on first open.

**O2 — Settings drawer opens + changes persist.**  Click the gear
icon.  Assert: a right-side Bootstrap offcanvas
(``.pql-nbedit-settings-drawer``) slides in with three controls —
``Theme`` (select), ``Font size`` (number), ``Autosave
debounce`` (number).  Defaults: ``vs-dark`` / ``13`` / ``1500``.
Change theme to ``vs`` (light); assert Monaco's background flips
from dark to ``rgb(255, 255, 254)`` within a tick (Monaco's
``setTheme`` is page-global).  Change font-size to ``18``; assert
``editor.getOptions().get(fontInfo).fontSize === 18`` and the
line heights visibly grow.  Change debounce to ``500``; edit a
cell; assert the ``Saved`` pill flips ~500 ms after last
keystroke (down from 1500 ms).  All three persist to
localStorage under
``pql.nbedit.theme.v1`` / ``pql.nbedit.fontSize.v1`` /
``pql.nbedit.autosave.debounceMs.v1``.

**O3 — Reload preserves settings.**  Reload the page.  Assert:
drawer re-initialises with the user's saved values; Monaco
opens in the light theme with 18 px font; autosave fires after
500 ms.  No ``ReferenceError`` on Alpine's x-show /
x-bind expressions during the pre-mount window — bootstrap.js's
tab-scope stub was extended with ``outlineVisible`` +
``outline`` + the four new Sprint-74 methods so the toolbar
template never evaluates an undefined symbol.

**O4 — Ctrl+Alt+/ keymap overlay.**  Focus Monaco.  Press
``Ctrl+Alt+/``.  Assert: a centred Bootstrap modal
(``.pql-nbedit-keymap-overlay``) opens with a 15-row table
listing every command — ``shiftEnter`` / ``ctrlEnter`` (direct
keybinds), then 13 ``pql.*`` palette actions (Sprint 62 +
70 + 73 + 74 additions).  Each row shows id / description /
binding / added-in-sprint.  Close via the ``×`` button; press
``Ctrl+Alt+/`` again → reopens.  (``Ctrl+/`` stays bound to
Monaco's default ``toggle-line-comment`` — we deliberately do
not shadow it.)

**O5 — Palette actions work.**  Open Monaco's built-in command
palette (``F1`` or ``Ctrl+Shift+P``).  Type ``pql.``.  Assert:
all 13 ``pql.*`` actions from the overlay show up with the same
id and label; firing any of them has the same effect as the
corresponding toolbar button or keybinding (e.g.
``pql.openSettings`` opens the drawer; ``pql.openHistory`` opens
the run-history popover for the cell at the cursor;
``pql.toggleOutline`` toggles the outline aside).

**O6 — Multi-tab theme sharing.**  Open two notebook tabs via the
Sprint-67 sidebar.  Change the theme in tab A; assert tab B's
Monaco also flips — ``monaco.editor.setTheme`` is page-global
(documented UX).  Font-size + debounce are per-instance, so
changing them in tab A does NOT bleed into tab B without an
explicit broadcast on that tab's editor too.  (Current
implementation: both tabs subscribe to
``document``-level ``pql:settings-changed`` events, so they DO
stay in sync by design — confirmed at replay time.)

**O7 — Phase 12.7 close state.**  Open
[ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md); scroll to the Phase 12.7 node.
Assert: header flipped ``⏳ open`` → ``✅ done`` with a close-out
prose block summarising Sprints 65-74 and their commit hashes.
CHANGELOG.md shows the Sprint 74 entry at the top of
``[Unreleased]``.

### Files changed (Sprint 74)

- [frontend/js/notebook/settings_drawer.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/settings_drawer.js)
  — new module.  Bootstrap offcanvas with theme / fontSize /
  debounce controls; broadcasts ``pql:settings-changed``
  CustomEvent on change; reads + persists via three localStorage
  keys under the ``pql.nbedit.*.v1`` namespace (Sprint-67 /
  Sprint-68 convention).
- [frontend/js/notebook/keymap_overlay.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/keymap_overlay.js)
  — new module.  Static 15-row commands array + Bootstrap modal
  renderer.  Reachable via the toolbar ``?`` button, ``Ctrl+Alt+/``
  keybind, and the ``pql.openKeymap`` palette action.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — imports both new modules; applies loaded settings on Monaco
  create (``theme`` / ``fontSize``); lifts ``_autosaveDebounceMs``
  out of module scope so ``scheduleAutosave`` reads it at
  flush-queue time; listens for ``pql:settings-changed`` and
  re-applies via ``monaco.editor.setTheme`` +
  ``editor.updateOptions({fontSize})`` + the debounce mutation;
  ``registerPaletteActions`` extended with
  ``pql.toggleOutline`` / ``pql.openHistory`` /
  ``pql.openSettings`` / ``pql.openKeymap``; new Alpine methods
  ``openSettings`` / ``openKeymap`` /
  ``openHistoryForCurrentCell``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js](../../frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js)
  — extended the tab-scope stub with ``outlineVisible`` /
  ``outline`` and the four new Sprint-74 Alpine methods so the
  pre-mount window does not emit ``ReferenceError`` on
  ``x-show`` / ``@click`` expressions.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](../../frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — gear + ``?`` toolbar buttons; bootstrap.js script tag bumped
  to ``?v=sprint74``.

### What the replay caught

**BUG-74-01 — double-backticks inside an HTML template literal
terminated the string early, crashing the mount.**  The keymap
overlay's ``buildModal`` included a footer explainer that used
GitHub-flavoured markdown-style double backticks (``\`pql.*\```)
inside the backtick-quoted ``.innerHTML`` template literal.
JavaScript's template-literal grammar does not nest backticks —
the first inner backtick closed the literal, and the rest of the
HTML became a syntax error inside ``buildModal``, which threw
the moment ``mountKeymapOverlay`` called it.  Symptom: Alpine's
``mount()`` caught the error at [main.js:317](../../frontend/js/notebook/main.js#L317)
with a ``Error @ http://…/main.js:317`` log; the settings drawer
mounted fine (earlier in the mount flow), but the keymap overlay
never materialised and the per-cell affordances never rebuilt.
Fix in the same commit: replaced ``\`\`pql.*\`\``` with plain
``pql.*`` text.  Caught pre-gate via
``mod.createNotebookTabEditor({...}).mount()`` in a cache-busted
import, which surfaced the real stack trace
(``buildModal@keymap_overlay.js:137:18``) that the
catch-and-log in mount hid.

### Phase 12.7 close

Sprint 74 is the final sprint of Phase 12.7.  The phase-12.7
ROADMAP node flips ``⏳ open`` → ``✅ done``.  Summary of what
landed across the phase:

- **Sprint 65** — module split + closure-refs factory + BUG-64-02
  reactivity-boundary grep gate.
- **Sprint 66** — cell-type registry + per-cell affordances (run
  button, status pill, exec-count pill, elapsed pill, inserter).
- **Sprint 67** — file-tree sidebar + notebook CRUD endpoints.
- **Sprint 68** — multi-notebook tab bar (N Monaco instances).
- **Sprint 69** — markdown-it + KaTeX + pencil-pin toggle.
- **Sprint 70** — outline / TOC panel + cell-jump.
- **Sprint 71** — SQL cell type (DuckDB via PQL.sql,
  ``result_var=``).
- **Sprint 72** — ipywidgets minimal placeholder (``comm_*``
  swallow + widget-view+json card).
- **Sprint 73** — per-cell run history + diff (Alembic 018).
- **Sprint 74** — settings drawer + keymap overlay + phase close.
