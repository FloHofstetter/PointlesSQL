# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Sprint 22.3 — Reference manual.**  The Reference section
  becomes the canonical surface for Python API, REST API, CLI,
  configuration, CloudEvents, and permissions.
  * `docs/reference/python/pql.md` — mkdocstrings directive
    against `pointlessql.pql.pql.PQL` plus a usage preface
    showing all 19 primitives.
  * `docs/reference/python/services.md` — mkdocstrings for five
    service modules: `agent_runs.operations`,
    `agent_runs.training_context`, `audit`, `branch_tags`,
    `mlflow_subprocess`.
  * `docs/reference/python/index.md` — landing distinguishing
    auto-gen (Python class methods) from hand-written (REST +
    CLI).
  * `docs/reference/api.md` — hand-curated top-30 REST reference
    grouped by tag (Auth, Agent runs, PQL writes, Models,
    Lineage, Branches, Audit cockpit, Reviews, Admin API keys,
    Audit sinks, Health/metrics) with tier icons (🍪 🔑 👮 🕵 ⚙)
    per route + canonical error envelope shape.  Auto-generated
    appendix for the remaining ~180 routes deferred to 22.5.
  * `docs/reference/cli.md` — `pointlessql` Typer surface with
    synopsis, options table, output sample, exit codes, "what's
    *not* in the CLI" list.
  * `docs/reference/configuration.md` — every `POINTLESSQL_*`
    env var grouped by `settings.py` sub-model (18 sub-models +
    four special agent-run env vars + `GHCR_PAT`) with rationale
    per setting.
  * `docs/reference/cloudevents.md` — all 12 emitted
    `pointlessql.<domain>.<verb>` event types with payload
    schemas + examples + HMAC-signing convention.
  * `docs/reference/permissions.md` — trust-tier matrix
    (Anonymous → Cookie → API key → +supervisor / +auditor →
    Admin), asymmetric scope ladder, FastAPI dependency mapping,
    plugin family gating, "why no per-table ACLs" rationale.
  * `docs/reference/index.md` — real audience-grouped landing.
  * `mkdocs.yml` nav: full Reference tree wired in (Python API
    sub-section + 5 reference pages).

- **Sprint 22.2 — Architecture + concepts pages.**  The Concepts
  section turns from three reference-style files into a real
  deep-dive surface — architecture, audit trail, lineage, and
  agent supervision each get a dedicated page with Mermaid
  diagrams and full schema breakdowns.
  * `docs/concepts/architecture.md` (NEW, ~250 lines): four
    logical layers (routes / services / PQL / storage), the
    soyuz-catalog boundary with bug-fix-at-source rule, two
    sequence diagrams (`pql.write_table` end-to-end and
    supervisor model promotion), why Python-only beats JVM for
    agent integration, full module map.
  * `docs/concepts/audit-trail.md` (NEW, ~280 lines): the cells /
    operations / queries 3-level model, the
    `agent_run_operations` schema (16 columns including the four
    Phase-21 additions), the `record_operation` forced-audit
    pattern, `params_json` examples per op-name, the rollback
    action loop, explicit boundary against shoreguard's LLM
    Provenance Log.
  * `docs/concepts/lineage.md` (NEW, ~210 lines): four-level
    row → column → value → inference chain with cost/opt-in
    matrix, schema for each table, sqlglot-driven column
    provenance, value-level CDF semantics with PII masking,
    bidirectional model DAG, aggregate fan-in (Phase 15.5),
    rejects table.
  * `docs/concepts/agent-supervision.md` (NEW, ~290 lines):
    Family A/B/C privilege tiers + tool counts, asymmetric scope
    ladder (auditor passes `require_supervisor` but not vice
    versa), wake-gate optimisation that skips the LLM on `ok`
    days, `agent_reviews` schema with `kind` discriminator,
    CloudEvents 1.0 fan-out shape, the four canonical bot
    personas (daily Audit-Reviewer, Compliance-Bot, Incident-
    Responder, Promotion-gate), trust-ladder Mermaid.
  * `docs/concepts/index.md`: real section landing with reading
    order recommendation.
  * `mkdocs.yml` nav: four new concept pages wired in above the
    existing reference-style ones.

- **Sprint 22.1 — Documentation landing + getting started.**  The
  site stops being placeholders and gets a real first impression.
  * `docs/index.md` rewritten as the hero landing — one-liner
    pitch, "What is PointlesSQL?" narrative, Mermaid ecosystem
    diagram (agents → plugin → PointlesSQL → soyuz / Delta), a
    before/after Python snippet that shows the value-prop
    concretely, comparison table against the no-PointlesSQL
    workflow, feature highlights deep-linking into the relevant
    e2e walkthroughs, "Where to next" link grid.
  * `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md` (NEW, 7 steps) — five-
    minute tour from `docker compose up` through "I just read a
    Delta table by name and saw the audit row pop up."  Uses the
    idempotent `scripts/seed-e2e.py` to lay down the `demo.sales`
    + `demo.hr` sample catalog, then walks through `pql.table()`
    + `pql.write_table(source_table_fqn=...)` with the lineage
    DAG showing the result.
  * `docs/getting-started/concepts.md` (NEW, ~250 lines) — the
    ten-minute mental-model read.  Four-layer stack, three-part
    name grammar, PQL primitive surface, agent runs as audit
    container, four-level lineage chain (with Mermaid), Audit
    Cockpit, Family A/B/C supervision tiers, Delta-branching,
    champion/challenger marker grammar, explicit "what
    PointlesSQL is not" section.
  * `mkdocs.yml` nav: Quickstart + Concepts-overview wired into
    Getting Started.
  * `README.md` polish: ASCII architecture block replaced with
    Mermaid (renders inline on GitHub), Documentation pointer
    added above Status, Status + Stack sections trimmed ~30 % to
    hand detail off to the docs site.  Stale `docs/install.md` /
    `docs/jobs.md` / `docs/adr/` references in `README.md` and
    `CLAUDE.md` updated to the post-22.0 layout.
  * Anchor `#docker--ghcr-images-recommended` →
    `#docker-ghcr-images-recommended` in
    `docs/getting-started/installation.md` (mkdocs slugify
    collapses `+` correctly; the old link was broken pre-move
    too).

- **Sprint 22.0 — Documentation site tooling foundation.**  Phase 22
  opens the docs track aimed at shoreguard-fresh's polish bar.  This
  sub-sprint lays the tooling without writing new content.
  * New `mkdocs.yml` (~140 lines) wires mkdocs-material with palette
    toggle, navigation tabs/sections/instant, mkdocstrings (Google
    docstring style), pymdownx superfences with a Mermaid custom-
    fence, and an eight-section `nav:` skeleton that explicitly
    lists all 38 e2e walkthroughs.
  * New `.github/workflows/docs.yml` runs `mkdocs build` on
    `workflow_dispatch` only — no auto-publish, no public URL, per
    the user's "local-only through Phase 22" pick.  The `gh-deploy`
    line is staged but commented out with a TODO marker pointing at
    the launch sprint that flips trigger + repo visibility + README
    badge in one shot.
  * `docs/` re-organised into the mkdocs-material layout: eight
    sections (`getting-started/`, `concepts/`, `guides/`,
    `reference/`, `integrations/`, `development/`, `decisions/`,
    `e2e-walkthroughs/`).  All file moves done with `git mv` so
    blame survives.  Eight new section index pages
    (`index.md`-each) describe what's filled in today and what
    later sub-sprints will add.
  * 14 stale move-induced cross-links fixed across the walkthrough
    folder, `installation.md`, and the hermes-jobs integration
    pages.  Remaining ~117 `mkdocs build` warnings are pre-existing
    source-tree references (the walkthroughs intentionally point at
    `../../frontend/...`, `../../pointlessql/...`) and are Sprint
    22.5's cross-link-sweep job — that's when `--strict` gets
    flipped back on.
  * `site/` added to `.gitignore` so the local build artefact
    doesn't leak into commits.
  * Plan: see
    `.claude/plans/dann-plane-diese-vollst-ndig-stateful-music.md`
    for the full six-sub-sprint phase shape.

- **Sprint 21.8 — Hermes plugin extension (Phase 21 cross-repo
  closure).** Two commits, one logical unit:
  * Server: extends `POST /api/pql/write_table` + `POST /api/pql/merge`
    bodies with optional `source_model_uri`; the write route
    auto-derives `source_table_fqn` from the SELECT when there's
    exactly one ref so the row-edge grain anchors cleanly.
    `PQL.merge()` Python sig grows the same kwarg for symmetry with
    `write_table`.  New `POST /api/pql/training/log` endpoint writes
    a one-shot `record_operation(op_name="train_model",
    training_params_json={"params":..., "metrics":...})` row — the
    HTTP-only equivalent of `pql.training_context()` for httpx
    callers.  Tests: 19 (3 source_model_uri + 7 training-log + 9
    write-routes regression).
  * Plugin (`hermes-plugin-pointlessql`, commit `f01d4e0`): adds 8
    new tools — `pql_list_models`, `pql_get_model`,
    `pql_get_model_predictions`, `pql_get_model_lineage`,
    `pql_get_model_runs`, `pql_get_promotion_history`,
    `pql_log_training_run` (always-on Family A) plus
    `pql_promote_model` (supervisor-gated, Family B).  Extends
    `pql_write_table` + `pql_merge` to accept `source_model_uri`.
    Tool count 34 → 42.  Tests: 19 new (10 model_tools + 5
    log_training + 2 write extension + 2 merge extension); 101/101
    plugin pytest grün.
  * Closes the "Closure pending (user job): Hermes plugin
    extension" item from the 21.0–21.7 close note in
    `project_phase21_closed.md`.

- **Phase 21 closed — ML Registry + Auditable Training.** Eight
  sub-sprints landed in two autonomous sessions on 2026-04-30:
  21.0 (MLflow subprocess + `/mlflow/` proxy + tab), 21.1 (soyuz
  UC-OSS `MODEL` Securable), 21.2 (cross-link `agent_run` ↔ MLflow
  run ↔ ModelVersion), 21.3 (forced autolog), 21.4 (hardware
  fingerprint), 21.5 (Models browse + 5-tab detail + compare),
  21.6 (champion/challenger promotion-hop), 21.7 (inference
  lineage). All eight share the audit-of-intent framing — capture
  enough to answer "wie wurde das Modell trainiert + wo schreibt
  es seine Predictions?" without claiming bit-identical replay.

- **Sprint 21.4 — Hardware/Library Fingerprint.** Adds a nullable
  `agent_run_operations.env_snapshot` Text column (Alembic
  `u1q3r5s7t9v1`) carrying an advisory JSON blob with three
  sub-keys: `python` (version + platform + cpu_count), `packages`
  (top-200 distributions via `importlib.metadata`, capped at
  4 KiB), `gpu` (when torch + CUDA available, per-device name +
  total memory). The snapshot is built once at module-import
  time and cached for the whole PointlesSQL process so subsequent
  `record_operation` calls don't re-walk `importlib.metadata` on
  every write — appropriate for an advisory fingerprint where a
  fork-side package add doesn't justify the per-op cost. The
  Run-detail Operations tab now renders a collapsed "Environment
  fingerprint" accordion under each op row showing the Python
  banner, the GPU list (if any), and the package list as an inner
  collapsed details block. End-to-end best-effort: every sub-step
  is wrapped in try/except and degrades to `None` rather than
  blocking the audit row. Honest reproducibility caveat: the
  blob captures the engineer's declared intent, not provability
  of bitwise reproducibility (CUDA non-determinism, parallel
  dataloaders, atomic-add ordering all leak through). 9 new
  pytest cases.

- **Sprint 21.3 — Forced Autolog (training param/metric capture).**
  New `pql.training_context()` context-manager wraps a training
  block, calls `mlflow.autolog()` for the requested framework hint
  (`"auto"` covers sklearn/xgboost/torch/tf out of the box), opens
  an MLflow run (or nests under an outer one), and at exit copies
  `run.data.params + run.data.metrics` into a JSON blob on
  `agent_run_operations.training_params_json` (new Alembic migration
  `t0p2q4r6s8u0`). The op_name enum gained `train_model`. The
  Run-detail Operations tab now renders a collapsed "Training
  params + metrics" accordion underneath each `train_model` row
  with the snapshot rendered as two side-by-side tables. The
  whole layer is best-effort: works without the mlflow extra
  (audit row still lands, snapshot stays empty), with an
  unreachable tracking server, and when the wrapped training body
  raises (partial autolog state is captured before re-raise so
  the audit trail never loses a training-event). 7 new pytest
  cases. Fail-loud `UnauditedTrainingError` and seed-interceptor
  capture deferred — the best-effort path here covers the
  audit-of-intent goal without blocking training when MLflow
  misbehaves.

- **Sprint 21.7 — Inference-Lineage (model → prediction tables).**
  Closes the second half of the model-lineage graph: when
  `pql.write_table(predictions, target, source_model_uri="models:/
  cat.sch.model/3")` runs, every row-edge it produces carries the
  originating model URI on a new `lineage_row_edges.source_model_uri`
  column (Alembic `s9o1p3r5t7u9`). The model-detail Lineage tab is
  now bidirectional: source-tables upstream with solid green
  `trained_from` edges, prediction-tables downstream with dashed
  blue `inferred_to` edges, plus a new "Prediction tables" card
  underneath the cytoscape view that lists each target FQN with its
  edge count. New `GET /api/models/{full_name}/predictions`
  endpoint reads `lineage_row_edges` directly (no soyuz round-trip,
  cost is O(R · E) on the audit DB rather than O(C · M · V)).
  `aggregate_prediction_tables_for_model` matches by
  `models:/{fqn}/%` so any version of the model contributes. The
  `build_model_lineage_graph` builder gained a `kind` field
  (`"model"` / `"table"` / `"prediction"`) on every node so the
  cytoscape style branches three ways. 10 new pytest cases.
  Drift alerts and a dedicated `pql.predict` helper are deferred
  to Phase 22+.

- **Sprint 21.6 — Champion/Challenger Promotion-Hop.** Operators (or
  supervisor-scoped agents) can now promote a `READY` model version
  to *champion* through `POST /api/models/{full_name}/promote`. The
  swap writes a `_pql_promotion` JSON marker into the registered
  model's `comment` (mirrors the Phase-21.2 `_pql_link` convention so
  the read-side parsers stay independent), inserts an `AgentReview`
  row with `kind="model_promotion"` so the Phase-19 cockpit fan-out
  can notify subscribers, and emits a `pointlessql.model.promoted`
  CloudEvent envelope. The 21.5 Permissions stub on
  `/models/{full_name}` is replaced by a Promotion tab: current
  champion card, per-version `[Promote]` button, mandatory-reason
  modal, and a collapsed promotion-history list. Champion badge
  also renders on the Versions tab. Supervisor or admin scope
  required (mirrors the Phase 13.11 ladder). New Alembic migration
  `r8n0p2q4s6u8` adds a non-null `kind` column to `agent_reviews`
  with `audit_review` as the default for backfill. New service
  module `pointlessql/services/model_promotion.py` carries the
  marker round-trip, current-champion resolver (falls back to
  highest-numbered READY version when no marker exists),
  `promote_version` service, history aggregator, and CloudEvent
  builder. `ModelsMixin` gains `update_registered_model`. First-
  class soyuz aliases deferred — the marker convention gives
  equivalent semantics without a soyuz schema bump and a future
  one-shot script can re-emit markers as real catalog tags once
  soyuz adds them. 17 new pytest cases.

- **Sprint 21.5 — registered-models browse surface.** Models now
  appear in the catalog tree per schema (alongside tables) and have
  a top-level `/models` index page in the icon rail. Each registered
  model has a detail page at `/models/{full_name}` with five tabs
  (Overview, Versions, Lineage, MLflow, Permissions); the Versions
  tab pulls params/metrics/tags from the linked MLflow run via
  `MlflowClient.get_run`, the Lineage tab renders a focused
  cytoscape DAG showing the model node + the source tables consumed
  by any Hermes-agent-run linked to a version of the model. A
  side-by-side compare view at `/models/{full_name}/compare?v1=N&v2=M`
  highlights metric deltas with a `lower-better`/`higher-better`
  classification heuristic and lists added/removed/changed params
  and tags. Anonymous access is gated by the existing auth
  middleware. New `ModelsMixin` on `UnityCatalogClient` exposes the
  four typed soyuz model RPCs the routes depend on
  (`list_registered_models`, `get_registered_model`,
  `list_model_versions`, `get_model_version`). The browser
  walkthrough at `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/models-tab.md` replays the
  full flow.

### Closed — Phase 21 audit-foundation: 21.0 + 21.1 + 21.2 (2026-04-30)

Vertical slice "audit-foundation for ML" landed in one autonomous
session: a Hermes-driven training run now records its MLflow context
into PointlesSQL's audit trail, the soyuz-catalog model-version row,
and a single-call cross-link aggregator. Three sub-sprints, install
`pip install pointlessql[ml]` to opt in.

* **Sprint 21.1 — soyuz UC-OSS MODEL Securable wire-compat for
  MLflow.** Soyuz commit `248f73f` (tag `v0.3.0rc1` local).
  Closes the wire-compat gap so MLflow's UC-OSS client
  (`mlflow.set_registry_uri("uc:http://...")`) can roundtrip:
  create model → create version (PENDING) → upload → finalize →
  READY → get/list/update/delete. Three additive endpoints
  (`finalizeModelVersion`, `temporary-model-version-credentials`)
  + status-state-machine fix + schema accommodation for the proto's
  URL-redundant body fields. Aliases stay out-of-scope — UC-OSS
  proto has no alias RPCs (only the Databricks variant).
* **Sprint 21.0 — MLflow Tracking subprocess + UI tab + reverse-proxy.**
  `MLflowSubprocess` lifecycle manager (HTTP health-check, PID file,
  graceful SIGTERM → SIGKILL) wired into the FastAPI `lifespan`.
  `/ml` HTML page mounts an iframe at `/mlflow/` which is served
  by a `httpx`-based reverse-proxy that injects the authenticated
  user as `X-MLflow-User` so the soyuz-side audit trail can
  correlate. New `MLflowSettings` (`POINTLESSQL_MLFLOW_*`) with
  optional URI overrides. Tab branded "ML" in the icon-rail.
* **Sprint 21.2 — Cross-link agent_run ↔ MLflow ↔ MODEL.**  Alembic
  `q7m9o1p3r5t7` adds `mlflow_run_id` columns to `agent_runs`
  and `agent_run_operations`. The op-recorder hot path sniffs
  `mlflow.active_run()` and stamps the run-id on both rows so a
  single SQL join answers "how was this model trained?". New
  `GET /api/runs/{id}/ml-context` aggregator returns the three-way
  join of agent-run + MLflow run + soyuz model-versions. Soyuz
  model-versions are tagged via a JSON marker in the `comment`
  field as a bridge until soyuz Sprint-25 tags-on-models lands.
  New CloudEvents type `pointlessql.mlflow.linked`.

22 new unit/integration tests + 4 live-soyuz smoke tests
(`test_mlflow_uc_oss_smoke.py`). Hermes-plugin `pql_mlflow_link_model`
tool deferred — auto-link via the recorder hook covers the core
flow; explicit linkage tool can land in a polish sprint once we
see the agent-pattern that needs it.

### Closed — Phase 17 polish: 17.3.1 + 17.5.1 (2026-04-29)

Two queued follow-ups land in one autonomous session.  17.6
(lineage trace sub-panes) stays queued — the ROADMAP-side
"defer until usage data" decision still holds.

* **17.3.1 — Lazy-load cytoscape on the Graph sub-tab.**  The
  three jsdelivr scripts (cytoscape ~280 KB + dagre ~50 KB +
  adapter) no longer ship on every ``/runs/{id}`` cold load.
  ``loadCytoscapeOnce()`` injects them on demand the first
  time the user activates the Graph sub-tab, gated on
  Bootstrap's ``shown.bs.tab``.  Promise-cached at module
  level; fail-soft on CDN block.
* **17.5.1 — Server-side tree search + DB-backed recents.**
  New ``recent_tables`` table (Alembic ``p6l8n0q3s5u7``)
  mirrors the Sprint-17.5 localStorage block in
  PointlesSQL's metadata DB so recents survive across
  devices.  ``GET /api/tree/search?q=`` walks the soyuz tree
  once and filters in-memory (capped@50) — significantly
  cheaper than shipping the full tree to a >1000-table
  browser.  Sidebar keeps localStorage as first-paint +
  no-auth fallback and overrides asynchronously for
  logged-in users.

Tests: 7 new (recents service).  Static gates clean.

### Closed — Phase 16.5: Delta-Branching (2026-04-29)

Seven sub-sprints (16.5.0 spike + 16.5.1 → 16.5.7) close the
Phase-16.5 design opened post-Phase-16.  Per-agent-run zero-copy
isolation: every run gets its own private branch of the target
schema, promote-to-main goes through an approval, discard is
free.

Spike (`docs/adr/0003-delta-branching-spike.md`) found the
zero-copy ideal isn't viable on cloud storage — delta-rs re-anchors
absolute Add-action paths.  Adopted **hybrid strategy**: symlink
on local FS, deep-copy on cloud (opt-in via
`branch.cloud_strategy`; default `"error"` refuses cloud
branching outright until the operator consciously opts into the
storage cost).

What's now in place:

- **`pql.branch(source, name)`** — atomic create flow that
  classifies storage scheme, picks strategy, creates UC schema
  + tables, clones parquets via
  `DeltaTable.create_write_transaction`, stamps
  `pointlessql.branch.*` tags, emits CloudEvent.
- **`pql.branch_discard(branch)`** — idempotent removal, refuses
  promoted / non-branch schemas, `shutil.rmtree`s the local-FS
  storage tree (symlinks unlink without recursing into source).
- **`pql.branch_promote(branch)`** — pointer-swap rename
  (parent → backup, branch → parent).  Per-table conflict
  detection BEFORE any UC mutation; if the parent moved during
  the branch's lifetime, `BranchPromotionConflictError` aborts
  with zero side effects.
- **`pql.branch_promote_preview(branch)`** — dry-run for the UI.
- **Control-Room UI** at `/branches` (admin-only).  List page
  with status / strategy / parent columns + status chips;
  detail page with metadata cards, parent-version table,
  audit-log tail, and an admin-only Danger-zone with Preview /
  Promote / Discard buttons.  Sidebar icon-rail entry under
  `bi-diagram-3`.
- **Auto-cleanup loop** (default-disabled).  Background task in
  the FastAPI lifespan + scheduler kind `"branch_cleanup"`;
  walks UC schemas, picks active branches past
  `branch.auto_cleanup_retention_days`, calls
  `discard_branch_schema` on each.
- **`branch_audit_log` table** (Alembic `o5k7m9p2r4t6`)
  captures create / promote / discard / auto_cleanup rows so
  audit trails survive the UC schema's deletion.
- **Three new CloudEvents** —
  `pointlessql.branch.created.v1`, `.promoted.v1`,
  `.discarded.v1`.

Tests: 14 (branch_tags) + 35 (create) + 10 (discard) +
11 (promote) + 11 (cleanup) = 81 new green pytest cases.
End-to-end coverage in
`docs/e2e-walkthroughs/branches.md` (notebook + browser combo).
Static gates clean — ruff / pyright / pydoclint / alembic.

### Closed — Phase 17: UI Overhaul (2026-04-29)

Five sub-sprints in one autonomous session, closing the
post-Phase-15.7 honest-UX-assessment punch list (top navbar
overloaded, run-detail tabs creaking, lineage UI linear,
table-detail vertical wall, catalog browser scroll-wall).

What's now in place:

- **Two-column sidebar** (Sprint 17.1).  60 px icon-rail with
  one icon per top-level section + 240 px contextual panel
  that swaps based on `active_section`.  Top navbar drops the
  inline nav row (only brand + Cmd+K + user menu remain).
  Mobile drawer keeps `nav_links.html` as fallback.
- **Run-detail tab consolidation** (Sprint 17.2).  10 flat
  tabs → 4 top-tabs (Overview / Operations / Lineage / Audit)
  with nav-pill sub-tabs.  Rollback card moves into a "Danger
  zone" inside Operations; `unattributed_writes` lifts out of
  Operations into an External-writes sub-tab in Audit; an
  inline hash-listener keeps Sprint-18.1 cross-axis deeplinks
  working.
- **Lineage-DAG view** (Sprint 17.3).  New
  `services/lineage_graph_builder.py` + `GET
  /api/runs/{run_id}/graph` join `lineage_row_edges` and
  `lineage_column_map` into a flat `{nodes, edges}` payload.
  New Lineage / Graph sub-tab embeds a cytoscape.js + dagre
  canvas with click-a-column-highlights-upstream-and-
  downstream behaviour.  CDN-loaded, scoped to the run-detail
  page only.
- **Table-detail tab refactor** (Sprint 17.4).  `pages/
  table.html` collapses from a long vertical card stack into
  six tabs (Overview / Preview / Columns / Lineage / Tags /
  Permissions); card content + Alpine factories preserved
  verbatim.
- **Catalog-Browser search + recents** (Sprint 17.5).
  Debounced filter input above the catalog tree + a "Recent
  tables" block surfacing the last five
  `catalog.schema.table` visits via
  `localStorage['pql.recentTables']`.

Numbers:

- 5 sub-sprint commits + this closing commit on PointlesSQL.
- 1 new backend module
  (`services/lineage_graph_builder.py`).
- 1 new public API endpoint
  (`GET /api/runs/{run_id}/graph`).
- 5 new template partials / files (`icon_rail.html`,
  `context_panel.html`, `user_menu.html` + CSS files for
  icon-rail and context-panel +
  `frontend/js/components/lineage_dag.js`).
- 0 new database tables / Alembic migrations — the
  RecentTable persistence lane stays in localStorage; a
  DB-backed sibling is parked as a 17.5.1 follow-up.

What's deferred:

- `/api/tree/search` server-side endpoint for >1000-table
  tenants (Sprint 17.5.1).
- Lazy-load of the cytoscape bundle on Lineage-Graph
  sub-tab click (Sprint 17.3.1) — today the bundle ships
  with every run-detail page, ~280 KB cold-cache.
- Sub-tab content for the Lineage top-pane beyond Summary +
  Graph (Row trace / Column trace / Value changes are
  separate full pages today; making them sub-panes would be
  a Phase-17.6 follow-up if the page-flip overhead becomes
  painful).

### Added — Sprint 17.5: Catalog-Browser search + recents (2026-04-29)

`components/sidebar.html` gains a debounced filter input above
the catalog tree and a "Recent tables" block surfacing the
last five `catalog.schema.table` visits.

Frontend:

- New `query` + `recents` reactive state on the existing
  Alpine `catalogTree()` factory.
- Six new helpers (`tableVisible`, `schemaVisible`,
  `catalogVisible`, `isCatalogExpanded`, `isSchemaExpanded`,
  `filteredEmpty`) drive the filter — case-insensitive
  substring match, partial-match branches force-expand, no
  match shows a friendly empty-state.
- Recent tables come from a localStorage key
  (`pql.recentTables`) written by a small `base.html`
  inline script (sibling of the Sprint-32 recent-catalogs
  writer); the script also dispatches a
  `pql:recent-tables-changed` CustomEvent so an open
  sidebar updates without a hard reload.
- Recents are FQN-deduped, capped at 5, with a "Clear"
  button that wipes the list.

Backend: no changes — the existing `/api/tree` payload
already returns the catalog → schema → table hierarchy the
filter walks.

Deferred to Sprint 17.5.1: server-side
`/api/tree/search?q=` for tenants with >1000 tables, and a
DB-backed `RecentTable(user_id, table_full_name,
last_visited_at)` model for cross-device recents.

### Added — Sprint 17.4: Table-detail tab refactor (2026-04-29)

`pages/table.html` collapses from a single long vertical stack
into six top-level tabs.  No new functionality — this is a pure
layout reorganisation.

| Tab          | Contents                                          |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Overview     | Metadata + Properties + PQL Snippet (copy)        |
| Preview      | `tablePreview()` Alpine card with version select  |
| Columns      | Columns table (+existing ≥20-col search) + Sprint-56 stats |
| Lineage      | `components/lineage_card.html` upstream/downstream graph |
| Tags         | `components/tags_editor.html`                     |
| Permissions  | `components/permissions_card.html` (effective-permissions toggle) |

What stayed:

- All Alpine factories (`tablePreview`, `tableStats`) and their
  inline `<script>` blocks — same `init()`, same fetch path,
  same Chart.js sparklines, same Sprint-20.3 version select.
- The Sprint-15.6 column-lineage badges next to each column
  name.
- The Sprint-30 effective-permissions toggle inside the
  Permissions card.
- Header (h1 + breadcrumbs), error alert path, and the
  `{% block extra_js %}` carrying `tableStats` continue to
  render unchanged.

What's deferred to a follow-up:

- Always-on column filter for any column count (today's
  threshold is ≥20).  The plan mentioned 50+ as the trigger;
  the existing 20+ behaviour is more aggressive and works
  fine, so no change for 17.4.
- Row history / sync history sub-tab — not currently surfaced
  on this page; would need a new endpoint to be useful.

### Added — Sprint 17.3: Lineage-DAG view (2026-04-29)

Third landing of Phase 17.  Adds a clickable graph view of the
combined row + column lineage for one run, sitting next to the
Sprint-17.2 Summary table inside the Lineage top-pane.

Backend:

- New `pointlessql/services/lineage_graph_builder.py` joins
  `lineage_row_edges` + `lineage_column_map` per `run_id`
  (and optional `op_id`) into a flat `{nodes, edges}` payload.
  One node per distinct table; one edge per
  `(source_table, target_table, op_id)` triple, with
  `transform_kinds`, `column_pairs`, and `row_edge_count`
  attached.
- New route `GET /api/runs/{run_id}/graph?op_id=...` in
  `runs_routes.py`, gated by `require_supervisor` (auditor or
  admin) — same scope ladder as the Sprint-19.1 audit-axis
  routes.

Frontend:

- New Lineage sub-tabs: Summary (the existing per-op edge
  table) and Graph (cytoscape canvas).  The Summary sub-pane
  keeps `id="tab-lineage"` so existing Sprint-18.1 op-row
  badges that link to `?op_id=N#tab-lineage` continue to land
  on the Summary view.
- New `frontend/js/components/lineage_dag.js` Alpine factory
  registered via `bootstrap.js`.  Loads the graph JSON, hands
  it to cytoscape with the dagre layout, and wires three
  highlight modes: node click (incident edges), edge click
  (side-panel column pairs), column click (every edge that
  touches that column — upstream + downstream simultaneously).
- cytoscape (3.30), dagre (0.8), cytoscape-dagre (2.5) from
  jsdelivr, loaded via a new `extra_js` block in
  `run_view.html` so the ~280 KB bundle hits only the
  run-detail page, not every authenticated route.
- Side-panel column-pair list is scrollable (max-height 280
  px) so wide aggregations stay tidy.

Behaviour:

- Empty-state when the run has no row edges or column-map
  rows: the canvas stays hidden and a friendly alert points
  at the PQL primitives that emit edges.
- `op_id` query parameter is honoured: when the user lands
  via the Sprint-18.1 cross-axis filter chip, the graph
  filters to that single op automatically.
- The `pre`-Sprint-15.6 case of "row edges but no column
  map" keeps surfacing as a node-to-node edge (annotated
  with the row count, no transform_kinds), so old runs are
  still rendered.

### Added — Sprint 17.2: Run-detail tab consolidation (2026-04-29)

`/runs/{id}` collapses from a single nav-tabs strip with 10 tabs
in one row into 4 top-level tabs with 11 nav-pill sub-tabs
distributed across them.  No backend or API changes — pure
template + Alpine surgery.

The new structure:

| Top-tab    | Sub-tabs                                          |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Overview   | Source · Cells · Events                           |
| Operations | Operations · Rejects · Queries · UC mutations     |
| Lineage    | Lineage summary (Sprint 17.3 will split into Row / Column / Value / Graph) |
| Audit      | Tool calls · Audit log · External writes (NEW)    |

What changed in `frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html`:

- Single `<ul class="nav nav-tabs">` strip + flat tab-content
  → 4-button top-tab strip + 4 top-panes, each carrying its own
  `<ul class="nav nav-pills">` for sub-tabs.
- The `unattributed_writes` alert that Sprint 13.7.5 surfaced
  inside the Operations tab is now its own *External writes*
  sub-pane in the Audit top-tab, with a friendly empty-state
  when no unattributed writes exist (so the sub-tab stays
  coherent when toggled).  The badge on the External-writes
  sub-tab carries the count.
- The Sprint 16.3 admin-only **Rollback** card moves from above
  the tab strip to the bottom of the Operations top-pane as a
  "Danger zone" card.  Same `rollbackPanel()` Alpine factory,
  same modal, same submit → /api/runs/{id}/rollback POST flow;
  only the location moves.
- A small inline hash-listener at the bottom of the template
  walks up the DOM from the targeted sub-pane and activates the
  parent top-tab too, so existing deeplinks like
  `/runs/{id}?op_id=N#tab-lineage` (Sprint 18.1 cross-axis
  drilldowns) keep landing on a visible pane.  Stale hashes
  fall back to the default sub-pane in Overview.
- Sprint 18.1's `op_id`-filter chip + Sprint 18.5's anomaly
  chip + the run-metadata / medallion-conformance / approval
  cards stay above the top-tab strip — outside the tab
  structure on purpose, so they remain visible regardless of
  which top-tab is active.

The 10 sub-pane IDs (`tab-cells`, `tab-ops`, …) and their
existing internal contents are preserved verbatim — only the
wrapping changes.  Sprint 18.1 cross-axis op-row badges that
link to `#tab-lineage` and `#tab-ops` therefore keep working
without edit.

### Added — Sprint 17.1: Two-column sidebar (2026-04-29)

First landing of Phase 17 (UI Overhaul).  The horizontal nav row
that crammed nine items into the topbar is replaced by a 60 px
icon-rail on the left and a 240 px contextual panel next to it.

What changed:

- New `frontend/templates/components/icon_rail.html` —
  vertical 60 px strip with one icon per top-level section
  (Federation / Runs / SQL / Workspace / Jobs / Alerts /
  Volumes / Dashboards + an admin-only Admin entry in the
  footer).  Active item is derived from a new `active_section`
  computed in `base.html` from the existing `active_page`.
- New `frontend/templates/components/context_panel.html` —
  240 px panel that dispatches by `active_section`: Federation
  reuses the existing catalog-tree (`components/sidebar.html`),
  Dashboards reuses the existing dashboards-tree, the seven
  remaining sections render a small static link list with a
  Cmd+K hint where useful.
- New `frontend/templates/components/user_menu.html` — current-
  user dropdown extracted out of `nav_links.html` so it can
  render standalone in the topbar (right side) at >= md.
- `frontend/templates/components/nav_links.html` is now
  drawer-only (< md, 768 px); the topbar drops its inline nav
  block.
- Mobile (< md) keeps the existing offcanvas drawer chrome but
  now carries: section panel + nav-links list + user menu, so
  phones have a single navigation surface (matches the new
  desktop layout in inverse order).
- New CSS `frontend/css/components/icon_rail.css` +
  `frontend/css/components/context_panel.css`; design tokens
  `--pql-icon-rail-width` (60 px) and `--pql-context-panel-width`
  (240 px) in `base.css`; `.pql-shell` grid is now
  `60 px 240 px 1fr` at >= md.

What stayed:

- Cmd+K command palette (Sprint 31/92) is unchanged.
- Notebook iframe page still uses `hide_sidebar=True` and
  fills the viewport — no rail or panel rendered.
- Login / register / error pages also use `hide_sidebar=True`,
  so the new chrome is never shown unauthenticated.
- The catalog-tree `<aside>` continues to ship its own
  `.border-end`; the new column also gets a wrapper border on
  `.pql-sidebar-shell` at >= md so non-tree section panels
  read as a column too.

### Closed — Phase 20: Forensics + Retention (2026-04-29)

Five sub-sprints landed in one autonomous session, closing the
"forensics + retention" governance pass that the post-Phase-15.7
strategy-conversation flagged as the orthogonal gap to the
already-shipped audit capture / display / query stack.

What's now in place:

- **Audit-stream forwarder** (Sprint 20.0). Six governance event
  types (`external_write.detected`, `cost_gate.denied`,
  `audit_export.issued`, `policy.violated`, `lineage.pruned`,
  `audit_sink.test`) fan out to admin-configured sinks of three
  types — webhook (HMAC), S3 (SigV4 PUT, supports
  MinIO/Cloudflare R2 via `endpoint_url`), AWS CloudTrail
  (PutAuditEvents).  Off by default; admin CRUD at
  `/api/admin/audit-sinks`.
- **Write-time PII redaction** (Sprint 20.1). `pii_mode` defaults
  to `hash_only`: any column whose name matches a built-in PII
  pattern (`email`, `phone`, `ssn`, `credit_card`, `iban`,
  `passport`, `first_name`, `address`, `birth`, +
  contains-`pii`) gets HMAC-SHA256-hashed at `record_value_changes`
  time.  `system_keys` table holds the auto-generated 32-byte
  secret.  `redact_with_audit_log` mode also appends one
  `audit_log` row per masked per-op call.
- **Lineage retention** (Sprint 20.2). Per-axis TTLs on the four
  lineage tables (defaults: row_edges 365, row_rejects 365,
  value_changes 730, column_map none).  Lifespan task ticks every
  24h; each prune appends an `audit_log` row + fires a
  `pointlessql.lineage.pruned` governance CloudEvent.
- **Time-travel value queries in UI** (Sprint 20.3).
  `pql.table_at_version` / `pql.table_at_timestamp`; routes
  `/api/tables/{fqn}/versions`,
  `/api/tables/{fqn}/preview-at-version`,
  `/api/lineage/row-at-version` (admin-gated); table-detail
  preview "View at:" select; row-trace admin-only version-input
  card.  `query_history.read_kind` enum extends with
  `pql_table_at_version`.
- **Cross-tool lineage facet ingest** (Sprint 20.4). PointlesSQL
  emits `columnLineage` + `valueChange` facets (the latter is a
  PointlesSQL extension, namespaced under `_producer`); soyuz
  ingests both via two new ORM models (`LineageColumnEdge`,
  `LineageValueChange`), Alembic `016`, expanded `ingest_event`
  walker, response counters
  (`accepted_column_edges`, `accepted_value_changes`).  PII
  values cross the wire pre-redacted.

Numbers:

- 5 commits on PointlesSQL: `1072170`, `b715f3f`, `ca07013`,
  `f06ba97`, `8050c2f` + this closing commit.
- 1 commit on soyuz-catalog: `2d73c87` (locally tagged
  `v0.2.0rc4`, push pending).
- 7 new tables / migrations across both repos
  (`audit_sinks`, `governance_events`, `system_keys`,
  `lineage_column_edges`, `lineage_value_changes` +
  PointlesSQL Alembic `m3h4i5j6k7l8` / `n4i5j6k7l8m9` +
  soyuz Alembic `016`).
- 3 new admin/operational walkthroughs
  (`docs/e2e-walkthroughs/audit-sinks.md`,
  `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/time-travel.md`,
  `docs/audit/pii-modes.md`).
- ~40 new public API surface points (admin CRUD + per-event-
  type emission helpers + 3 time-travel routes).

What's deliberately out of scope:

- Admin HTML page for audit-sinks — JSON-only routes shipped;
  page is a Phase-20.6+ follow-up.
- Soyuz tag-driven PII detection at write time — would dominate
  per-write cost; the Phase-18 render-time masking still gates
  tagged-but-non-pattern columns at the API surface.
- Foreign-producer `valueChange` schema validation — soyuz
  documents the facet as PointlesSQL-defined and ingests
  permissively.
- Pushing the `v0.2.0rc3` / `v0.2.0rc4` soyuz tags — same
  posture as the Phase-14 push that's still pending; install
  works because both response-shape extensions are additive.

### Added — Sprint 20.4: Soyuz columnLineage + valueChange (2026-04-29)

Cross-tool sibling to the PointlesSQL-only column / value lineage
stack.  Two OpenLineage facets now flow from PointlesSQL emission
into soyuz-side persistence:

- `services/soyuz_lineage.emit_event_sync` accepts optional
  `column_edges` + `value_changes` lists.  Builds
  `outputs[*].facets.columnLineage` (spec 1.x) and
  `outputs[*].facets.valueChange` (PointlesSQL extension under
  `_producer = "https://github.com/FloHofstetter/pointlessql"`).
- `operations._emit_lineage_after_commit` threads the recorder's
  `pending_column_edges` + `pending_value_changes` through so every
  merge / declarative write that already populates
  `LineageColumnMap` + `LineageValueChange` (Phases 15.6 + 15.7)
  automatically surfaces in soyuz too.
- PII safety: PointlesSQL emits **already-redacted** values when
  `pii_mode != store_clear` (Sprint 20.1's default `hash_only`
  rewrites `old_value` / `new_value` to a 16-hex HMAC), so soyuz
  never sees cleartext.

Soyuz changes (commit pending push, locally tagged `v0.2.0rc4`):
two new ORM models (`LineageColumnEdge`, `LineageValueChange`),
Alembic `016`, `ingest_event` facet walker, response counters
(`accepted_column_edges`, `accepted_value_changes`).  See
`../soyuz-catalog/CHANGELOG.md` for the full soyuz-side notes.

### Added — Sprint 20.3: Time-travel value queries in UI (2026-04-29)

Surfaces the version arithmetic
`agent_run_operations.delta_version_after` already captures.

- New `pql.table_at_version(fqn, n)` + `pql.table_at_timestamp`
  helpers wrap `DeltaTable.load_as_version`.  Each call writes a
  `query_history` row with `read_kind="pql_table_at_version"`.
- New `api/time_travel_routes.py` exposes three read-only routes:
  `GET /api/tables/{fqn}/versions` (history joined with
  `agent_run_operations` so each version names the originating
  run when known), `GET /api/tables/{fqn}/preview-at-version`
  (paged rows up to 200), `GET /api/lineage/row-at-version`
  (admin-gated single-row lookup keyed on `_lineage_row_id`).
- Table-detail preview card gains a "View at:" select.
  Row-trace page gains an admin-only "View this row at version"
  card.  Both consume the new API.
- `query_history.read_kind` enum extends with
  `pql_table_at_version` so `/queries` surfaces time-travel reads
  alongside ordinary `pql.table()` calls.
- Browser-replay playbook in `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/time-travel.md`.

### Added — Sprint 20.2: Lineage retention TTLs (2026-04-29)

Bounded-growth invariant on the four lineage tables.  Each axis
gets its own retention threshold; the pruner runs as a lifespan
task next to the existing audit-cleanup loop.

- New `services/lineage_pruner.py`: `prune_once` (sync DB I/O) +
  `prune_once_async` (async wrapper that fires one
  `pointlessql.lineage.pruned` governance CloudEvent per axis
  after the DB commit).  Each per-axis prune appends an
  `audit_log` row (`actor_role=system`, `action=lineage_prune`,
  `target=lineage_<axis>`, `detail={deleted, cutoff,
  threshold_days}`).
- `LineageRetentionSettings` (env prefix
  `POINTLESSQL_AUDIT_LINEAGE_RETENTION_*`) with per-axis
  `*_days` thresholds.  `None` / `0` skips the axis.  Defaults:
  row_edges 365, row_rejects 365, value_changes 730,
  column_map `None`.
- `_lineage_pruner_loop` lifespan task ticks every
  `audit.cleanup_interval_seconds` (default 24h).  Active only
  when at least one axis has a positive threshold.
- Sprint 20.0's `EVENT_TYPE_LINEAGE_PRUNED` finds its first
  emitter.  Audit-stream sinks see prunes alongside external-
  write detections and cost-gate denials.

### Added — Sprint 20.1: PII detection + masking write-hook (2026-04-29)

Sprint 20.1 closes the cleartext-at-rest gap on
`lineage_value_changes`.  Render-time masking from Phase 18.2 only
protected the API surface; this sprint rewrites the row before it
hits SQLite when `pii_mode` is anything other than `store_clear`.

- New `system_keys` table (Alembic `n4i5j6k7l8m9`) for the lazy
  install-scoped PII hash secret.  First-write generates a
  32-byte URL-safe random token.
- `services/pii_redactor.py` ships pattern-based PII detection
  (regex over column names — covers `email`, `phone`, `ssn`,
  `credit_card`, `iban`, `passport`, `first_name`, `last_name`,
  `address`, `birth`, plus generic `pii` substring), HMAC-SHA256
  hashing (16 hex chars, equality-joinable), and the literal
  `<redacted>` placeholder.
- `record_value_changes` accepts `pii_mode` + `pii_hash_secret`
  parameters.  `store_clear` keeps pre-20.1 behaviour;
  `hash_only` (the new default) rewrites old/new values to a
  16-hex HMAC for any pattern-matched column;
  `redact_with_audit_log` substitutes the literal `<redacted>`
  and appends one `audit_log` row per masked per-op call.
- `operations._record_value_changes_after_commit` resolves
  `Settings` and forwards the mode + secret automatically;
  primitives stay agnostic.
- Soyuz tag-driven PII detection stays out of the sync write path
  (would dominate per-write cost).  The Phase-18 render-time
  masking still gates tagged-but-non-pattern columns at the API.
- `docs/audit/pii-modes.md` documents the three modes, secret
  bootstrap, migration impact, and the verification recipe.
- Existing `lineage_value_changes` rows are NOT rewritten — soft
  transition.  Historical cleartext stays readable to admins via
  render-time masking; new writes hash.

### Added — Sprint 20.0: Audit-Stream forwarder (2026-04-29)

Phase 20 opens with the audit-stream forwarder: a settings-driven,
plug-in-typed CloudEvents fan-out that mirrors the existing webhook
dispatcher's HMAC + retry contract for new sink types.

- New `audit_sinks` table (id, name, type, config_json,
  is_active, event_types_json, created_at) plus FK-free
  `governance_events` table for non-run-scoped CloudEvents.
  Alembic `m3h4i5j6k7l8`.
- Three sink types ship: `webhook` (reuses the saved-query alert
  dispatcher), `s3` (httpx + minimal SigV4 signer at
  `services/aws_sigv4.py`, works against MinIO / R2 by setting
  `endpoint_url`), `aws_cloudtrail` (PutAuditEvents to the
  CloudTrail Data Service). SigV4 implementation verified against
  the AWS reference test vector.
- Five governance event types fire from the existing audit
  surfaces: `pointlessql.external_write.detected` (scanner),
  `cost_gate.denied` (`/api/sql/explain` when `needs_approval`
  flips true), `audit_export.issued` (`/admin/audit/export`),
  `policy.violated` (free hook for future), `lineage.pruned`
  (paired with Sprint 20.2). Run-lifecycle events stay on the
  Phase-13 `agent_run_events` path; admins flip
  `POINTLESSQL_AUDIT_STREAM_MIRROR_LIFECYCLE_TO_SINKS=1` to fan
  those into `audit_sinks` too.
- Admin CRUD at `/api/admin/audit-sinks` (GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE)
  with sensitive-key redaction on read-back, a `POST .../{id}/test`
  synthetic-envelope endpoint, and a `GET .../recent-events`
  tail of the last 50 governance rows.
- Off by default — `POINTLESSQL_AUDIT_STREAM_ENABLED=0`. The
  governance row always persists (durability matters); only the
  outbound POST is gated.
- Operational runbook in `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/audit-sinks.md`
  (curl-driven, no browser). Admin HTML page deferred to the
  Phase-20 close-memo bug-hunt sweep.

### Closed — Phase 19: Audit-Reviewer Agent + Grafana (2026-04-29)

Six sub-sprints landed across two days, closing the original
"agents reviewing agents" thesis from the Phase-19 sketch.  The
audit lake captured by Phase 14-15 + the cockpit surface from
Phase 18 are now driven by three real personas, plus the Grafana
glance-trust dashboard that was Phase 19's quick-win opener.

Personas served:

- **Daily Audit-Reviewer-Agent** (Sprint 19.2.0/1/2) — Hermes cron
  at 06:00 UTC; wake-gate skips the LLM round-trip on clean days,
  on `warn`/`critical` the agent drafts Markdown, posts via
  `pql_post_audit_review` (PointlesSQL is the source of truth),
  PointlesSQL fans the CloudEvent out to admin-configured webhook
  destinations, Hermes also delivers via its own platform adapters.
  Cockpit "Latest review" card on `/` + `/agent-reviews/{id}`
  detail page.
- **Compliance-Bot** (Sprint 19.3) — read-only Hermes one-shot
  triggered by Slack/Matrix DM. Answers ad-hoc questions with the
  four-block Question/Answer/How/Caveats skeleton. Five hard
  prompt constraints (no writes, mandatory masking, no API-key
  echo, time-window pinning, refuse-and-escalate on remediation
  asks). New `/api/audit/principal-summary` route + matching
  plugin tool fill the runs-by-principal enumeration gap.
- **Incident-Responder** (Sprint 19.4) — multi-turn drill-down
  for "was hat Run X kaputt gemacht?". Takes a `run_id` up
  front, walks failing op → rejects → external-write neighbours.
  Pure prompt composition — no new server endpoints. Synthetic
  broken-run fixture (`scripts/seed-broken-run.py`) for replays.

Numbers:

- Plugin grew 29 → 32 tools (`pql_post_audit_review`,
  `pql_get_latest_review`, `pql_principal_summary`).
- Two new tables (`agent_reviews`, `review_destinations`,
  Alembic `l2g3a4b5c6d7`).
- Two new admin-gated CRUD routes for review destinations + four
  new auditor-gated agent-review routes (POST + latest + detail +
  principal-summary).
- One Hermes pre-run script (`scripts/audit-wake-gate.py`).
- Three new walkthroughs in `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/`
  (audit-reviewer-daily, compliance-bot, incident-responder)
  + three Hermes job manifests in `docs/hermes-jobs/`.
- Six commits (`57ec67c`, `8d6de75`, `fe5d26d`, `4735b76`,
  `51659b6`, plus the closing commit) against PointlesSQL; two
  commits (`ac57fed`, `14ad3ea`) against `hermes-plugin-pointlessql`.

What's deliberately out of scope:

- Conversation memory for the chat personas — that's Hermes' job;
  see the limitations sections in
  `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/{compliance-bot,incident-responder}.md`.
- "Auto-fix" / "draft remediation PR" personas. The read-only
  posture is the design intent — Sprint 19.5+ could add a
  write-shaped persona, but that's a different conversation.
- Per-job env overlays in Hermes. All cron jobs in an install
  share `~/.hermes/.env`; if you need separate keys per job, add
  Hermes-side feature support first.

### Added — Sprint 19.4: Incident-Responder persona (2026-04-29)

Third Phase-19 persona: multi-turn Hermes flow for "was hat Run X
kaputt gemacht?".  Takes a ``run_id`` up front (typically pasted from
a banner alert / deploy log), walks down to root cause across the
existing per-run audit axes, never recommends a write.

- **No new server endpoints.**  This sprint is purely prompt
  composition + a fixture: every tool the responder uses landed in
  Sprint 19.1.  The plugin tool-count is unchanged at 32.

- **System prompt + manifest** at
  ``docs/hermes-jobs/incident-responder.{md,json}``.  Three-block
  answer skeleton (Finding / Evidence / Next) optimised for
  follow-up questions.  Five hard constraints: stay focused on
  one run, never recommend a write, mention rollback as an option
  exactly once per conversation, surface external-write neighbours
  proactively, be terse (operator is on call).

- **Synthetic broken-run fixture** at
  ``scripts/seed-broken-run.py``.  Inserts one
  :class:`AgentRun` with status ``failed``, three
  :class:`AgentRunOperation` rows (``autoload`` ok / ``merge``
  errored on schema mismatch / ``write_table`` accumulated rejects),
  ~50 :class:`LineageRowReject` rows, and 2
  :class:`UnattributedWrite` rows landing in the same window.  Plus
  one extra ``succeeded`` run for the same principal so per-
  principal aggregations have a non-trivial denominator.  Prints
  the run_id for use in the chat prompt.

- **e2e walkthrough** at
  ``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/incident-responder.md`` exercises three
  drill-down patterns (failing op, op-3 rejects, proactive
  external-write callout) and four safety properties (refuses
  writes, rollback mentioned at most once, masking on
  value-changes, audit-of-audit history matches the tool surface).

### Added — Sprint 19.3: Compliance-Bot (ad-hoc Slack/chat persona) (2026-04-29)

Read-only Hermes one-shot flow that answers ad-hoc compliance
questions over the existing auditor toolset.  The persona name comes
from the original Phase-19 sketch: "welche Runs schrieben Q3 auf
PII-Spalten?" via Slack DM or slash-command.

- **New ``GET /api/audit/principal-summary``** (auditor-gated).
  Aggregates :class:`AgentRun` rows for one ``principal`` over a
  window and returns headline counters (runs, ops, rejects,
  value_changes, external_writes) plus the most recent ``limit``
  runs.  Closes the gap between Sprint 19.1's per-run audit axes and
  the persona's "enumerate runs by principal first" pattern.
  Self-tracks as ``read_kind='audit_api'`` like the rest of
  ``/api/audit/*``.

- **Plugin tool ``pql_principal_summary``.**  Required arg
  ``principal``; optional ``since`` / ``until`` / ``limit`` (1–200,
  server clamped).  Goes into ``register_auditor_tools`` so it loads
  only when ``POINTLESSQL_AUDITOR_MODE=1``.  Plugin grows from 31
  → 32 tools.

- **System prompt + manifest** at
  ``docs/hermes-jobs/compliance-bot.{md,json}``.  Four-block answer
  skeleton (Question / Answer / How / Caveats) so auditors can
  reproduce any answer from the tool-call trail.  Five hard
  constraints in the prompt: no writes, mandatory masking on
  value-changes, no API-key echo, mandatory time-window pinning,
  explicit refusal-and-escalation when the question would require a
  write.  Manifest uses Hermes' wake-on-message dispatch (no cron
  schedule); the chat-platform adapter routes incoming messages.

- **e2e walkthrough** at
  ``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/compliance-bot.md`` exercises the three
  canonical question shapes (runs-by-principal, yesterday's external
  writes, high-reject runs) and asserts the four safety properties:
  read-only refusal works, value-changes always masked, API-key never
  appears in output bytes, audit-of-audit history matches the
  observed tool surface.

### Added — Sprint 19.2.2: Wake-gate (skip clean days) (2026-04-29)

Optimisation pass on the daily Audit-Reviewer-Agent: most days have
nothing to report, and burning a full LLM round-trip on those days is
pointless and expensive.

- **`scripts/audit-wake-gate.py`.**  Hermes pre-run script invoked
  before the LLM call.  Hits `GET /api/audit/anomalies` for the three
  metrics (rejects, errored_ops, external_writes) against the
  closed-day window, prints a `#`-prefixed human-readable context
  block (the agent sees this as prompt context when it does wake),
  and emits the wake-gate JSON line as the FINAL non-empty stdout
  line.  On `ok` days the line is
  `{"wakeAgent": false, "severity": "ok"}` and Hermes skips the LLM
  round-trip per the contract in
  `hermes-agent/cron/scheduler.py:_parse_wake_gate`.  Failures
  (PointlesSQL unreachable, missing API key) fail open: the script
  always exits 0 and returns `{"wakeAgent": true}` so a transient
  outage never silences a real anomaly day.

- **Manifest update.**  `docs/hermes-jobs/audit-reviewer-daily.json`
  carries `"script": "scripts/audit-wake-gate.py"`.  The prompt is
  rewritten to trust the wake-gate's pre-fetched verdicts: the agent
  no longer re-calls `pql_anomaly_check` for the same window, saving
  one LLM round-trip on every `warn`/`critical` day too.

- **Walkthrough update.**  `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/audit-reviewer-daily.md`
  gains a step-7 verification path (clean day → no LLM iteration row
  in PointlesSQL; seeded reject row → LLM fires) and a cost note
  (clean-day cost: 3 HTTP round-trips vs. one LLM call worth
  one-to-three orders of magnitude more tokens).

### Added — Sprint 19.2.1: Review persistence + CloudEvents fan-out + cockpit card (2026-04-29)

Second half of Phase-19's "Audit-Reviewer-Agent reference run" sub-phase.
PointlesSQL now persists every posted review, fans the CloudEvents
envelope out to admin-configured webhooks (alongside Hermes-native
delivery), and surfaces the result on the home cockpit so operators
see yesterday's verdict without leaving the UI.

- **New ``agent_reviews`` table.**  Alembic migration
  ``l2g3a4b5c6d7_agent_reviews`` adds (id, run_id FK ``agent_runs.id``
  nullable, period_start, period_end, severity ``ok|warn|critical``,
  summary_md, payload_json, delivered_to_json, created_at) +
  CHECK constraints on severity and ``period_end > period_start``.

- **New ``review_destinations`` table.**  Admin-configured webhook
  sinks (name, webhook_url, hmac_secret, is_active, min_severity).
  ``min_severity`` gates noise: a ``warn``-default destination won't
  receive an ``ok``-day review.

- **``services/review_dispatcher``.**  Thin wrapper around
  ``alert_dispatcher.dispatch_webhook``: builds a
  ``pointlessql.agent_review.posted.v1`` CloudEvent, enumerates
  active destinations whose ``min_severity`` gate passes, fans out
  with HTTP+HMAC+retry, and persists the per-destination outcome
  (status code + URL hash, never the cleartext URL) onto
  ``AgentReview.delivered_to_json``.

- **Three auditor-gated agent-review routes.**
  ``POST /api/agent-reviews`` (validates bounds, persists, dispatches,
  returns the persisted row + fan-out log),
  ``GET /api/agent-reviews/latest`` (cockpit + plugin reads),
  ``GET /api/agent-reviews/{id}`` (detail JSON).
  Privilege ladder: auditor 200, supervisor 403, bare key 403,
  cookie admin 200.  ``GET /agent-reviews/{id}`` is the corresponding
  HTML detail page (admin-gated; auditor keys stay HTTP-only).

- **Four admin-gated review-destination routes** at
  ``/api/admin/review-destinations``.  Mirrors the existing
  admin-api-keys CRUD: list, create-with-secret-display, patch
  (sparse), delete.  Hard-delete is fine because
  ``AgentReview.delivered_to_json`` already records the destination's
  ``url_hash`` + ``name`` so historical fan-out attribution survives.

- **Cockpit "Latest review" card on ``/``.**  Admin-only.  Severity
  pill + rendered Markdown digest + period chip + "Full transcript"
  button → ``/agent-reviews/{id}``.  Lookup is best-effort with the
  same posture as Sprint 18.5's anomaly banner: a fresh-install
  pointlessql with no reviews yet renders the home page without the
  card, no error.

- **Detail page** at ``/agent-reviews/{id}``.  Three-column layout:
  Markdown summary + (optional) replay payload pretty-printed JSON,
  metadata sidebar (run_id link, severity, window), and the
  dispatcher fan-out log card listing every destination by name +
  url_hash + status_code.

- **Plugin grows from 29 → 31 tools.**  ``pql_post_audit_review``
  posts the rendered Markdown digest at the end of the daily review
  (now the final step of the Sprint-19.2.0 prompt).
  ``pql_get_latest_review`` reads the most recent review back so the
  Compliance-Bot / Incident-Responder personas can anchor their
  answers to yesterday's verdict.

### Added — Sprint 19.2.0: Daily-review Hermes job + auditor key bootstrap (2026-04-29)

First half of Phase-19's "Audit-Reviewer-Agent reference run" sub-phase.
Wires the operator-facing onboarding for the daily 06:00 UTC anomaly
digest: the CLI to mint an auditor-scoped API key, the reference Hermes
cron manifest, and an operational runbook that chains the two.

No server-side schema changes — Sprint 19.2.1 is the one that adds the
``agent_reviews`` + ``review_destinations`` tables.

- **New ``pointlessql admin issue-auditor-key`` Typer subcommand.**  The
  existing ``[project.scripts] pointlessql = "...:cli"`` entry point
  grew a Typer app: invoking ``pointlessql`` with no arguments still
  starts the uvicorn dev server (backward-compat via an
  ``invoke_without_command=True`` callback), and ``pointlessql admin
  issue-auditor-key --name=… [--supervisor]`` mints a fresh API key
  with ``api_keys.auditor=True``.  The plaintext token is printed
  exactly once and cannot be recovered afterwards — same hash-only
  storage discipline as Sprint 13.11's admin HTTP route.

- **Reference Hermes-cron manifest** at
  ``docs/hermes-jobs/audit-reviewer-daily.json``.  Schedule
  ``0 6 * * *``, ``enabled_toolsets: ["pointlessql"]``, ``deliver:
  "local"`` (Slack / email fan-out is opt-in via
  ``hermes cron edit --deliver``), and a self-contained prompt that
  pins the audit window to ``[yesterday-00:00 UTC, today-00:00 UTC)``
  so the digest is deterministic regardless of when the cron actually
  fires.  Renders Markdown to a fixed skeleton so downstream consumers
  (Sprint 19.2.1's cockpit card, future digest aggregators) can
  parse it.

- **``docs/hermes-jobs/README.md``** — index for the manifest folder.
  Documents why ``hermes cron create`` does not yet expose the
  ``--enabled-toolsets`` flag the auditor flow needs (so the
  walkthrough installs the manifest by editing
  ``~/.hermes/cron/jobs.json`` directly), the
  ``POINTLESSQL_AUDITOR_MODE`` plugin-side opt-in, and the lack of
  per-job env overlays in Hermes (``~/.hermes/.env`` is reloaded fresh
  per cron tick).

- **``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/audit-reviewer-daily.md``** — operational
  runbook (CLI + cron, no browser) chaining: mint key → ``.env``
  overlay → ``jobs.json`` patch → ``hermes cron run`` + ``tick`` →
  cross-check ``GET /api/audit/history?read_kind=audit_api`` rows
  attributed to ``api_key:daily-review``.  Closes the loop on
  audit-of-audit observability for the new flow.

### Added — Sprint 19.1: Audit-read tools + ``auditor`` scope (2026-04-28)

Sprint 19.1 closes the gap between the Phase-18 audit-data plane
and Phase-19's three consumer flows (Audit-Reviewer-Agent,
Compliance-Bot, Incident-Responder).  Adds a fourth privilege
scope, lifts the read endpoints out of admin-only gating, exposes
five new run-scoped JSON axes, and grows
``hermes-plugin-pointlessql`` from 20 → 29 tools.

- **New ``auditor`` scope on ``api_keys``.**  Alembic migration
  ``k1f2a3b4c5d6_api_keys_auditor`` adds a ``BOOLEAN NOT NULL
  DEFAULT 0`` column.  ``KeyEntry`` gains an ``auditor`` field;
  ``parse_keys`` now accepts ``name:secret:auditor`` env entries
  alongside the existing ``:supervisor`` form.  Middleware sets
  ``request.state.api_key_auditor`` from the verified bearer.
  New ``require_auditor`` dependency in
  ``pointlessql/api/dependencies.py`` enforces the gate;
  ``require_supervisor`` is widened to also accept the auditor
  scope so a single auditor key drives both tenant-wide and
  per-run audit reads without inheriting supervisor's
  approve/deny privileges or admin's PII-reveal.

- **Phase-18 audit endpoints lowered to ``require_auditor``.**
  ``GET /api/audit/summary``, ``/timeseries``, and ``/anomalies``
  no longer require an admin cookie — an auditor key is enough.
  ``POST /api/audit/pii/reveal`` stays admin-only.

- **Five new run-scoped JSON endpoints** under
  ``/api/agent-runs/{run_id}/audit/<axis>``:
  - ``lineage`` wraps the existing
    ``load_lineage_summary_for_run`` helper (per-op row-edge
    counts).
  - ``rejects`` wraps ``load_rejects_for_run`` (Sprint-15.5.3
    rejected rows).
  - ``value-changes`` queries ``lineage_value_changes`` directly
    and **always masks ``old_value`` / ``new_value`` for non-admin
    callers** — auditor scope cannot un-mask, regardless of the
    ``mask=false`` query flag.  Admin cookie + ``mask=false``
    surfaces cleartext via the same response shape; the
    historical admin-only ``POST /api/audit/pii/reveal`` is
    unchanged.
  - ``external-writes`` wraps ``load_unattributed_for_run``
    (filters to the run's ``tables_touched`` JSON list +
    ``acknowledged_at IS NULL``).
  - ``column-lineage`` queries ``lineage_column_map`` directly
    (per-run source-column → target-column edges).

  All five validate the run id up-front via ``_ensure_run_visible``
  and return ``CatalogNotFoundError`` (404) on stale UUIDs rather
  than empty rows.  Three formerly-private helpers in
  ``runs_routes.py`` (``_load_lineage_summary_for_run`` →
  ``load_lineage_summary_for_run`` etc.) were renamed when their
  cross-module use surfaced — strict pyright was rightfully
  complaining about ``reportPrivateUsage`` once
  ``agent_runs_routes`` started reaching for them.

- **New tenant-wide ``GET /api/audit/history``.**  Paginated
  ``query_history`` walk for the audit-of-audit traversal flow.
  Default response **excludes ``read_kind='audit_api'`` rows**
  so an audit-reviewer agent doesn't loop on its own
  breadcrumbs; ``?include_audit_api=true`` or
  ``?read_kind=audit_api`` lift the filter.  Routes through the
  existing ``list_queries`` service.

- **Anomaly-baseline bugfix in
  :func:`audit_aggregator.anomalies`.**  When the caller bounds
  ``since`` to (e.g.) yesterday-00:00 UTC, the previous
  implementation returned only points inside ``[since, until)``
  to the rolling-baseline loop, leaving the first bin with an
  empty baseline and false-positive ``critical`` verdicts.  Fix
  widens the underlying ``timeseries`` query by ``window_days``
  internally, then trims the response back to ``[since, until)``
  via a new dialect-safe ``_bin_floor_compare_string`` helper
  (SQLite ``%Y-%m-%d`` vs Postgres ``date_trunc(...)::String``
  reconciled by a 10-/16-char prefix compare).  This unblocks the
  Sprint-19.2 daily reviewer's "yesterday closed-day verdict"
  prompt.

- **Audit-of-audit logging on every new endpoint.**  Each new
  audit-read endpoint records a synthetic ``query_history`` row
  with ``read_kind='audit_api'`` via a new
  ``_record_audit_self`` helper (mirror of the existing
  ``_record_self`` in ``audit_routes.py``).  Server-side, not
  plugin-side — a malicious agent cannot turn off the
  audit-of-audit trail.

- **Plugin-side: 9 new tools in ``hermes-plugin-pointlessql``.**
  Bumps the registered count from 20 to 29.  New
  ``POINTLESSQL_AUDITOR_MODE`` env flag (analog to the existing
  ``POINTLESSQL_SUPERVISOR_MODE``) gates a new
  ``register_auditor_tools`` factory:
  - ``pql_list_recent_runs`` — generic recent-N-runs listing
    (the existing ``pql_runs_by_principal`` /
    ``pql_runs_by_agent`` cover filtered listings).
  - ``pql_audit_summary`` — wraps both ``/api/audit/summary``
    (``mode="counts"``) and ``/api/audit/timeseries``
    (``mode="timeseries"``) behind one tool.
  - ``pql_anomaly_check`` — wraps ``/api/audit/anomalies``.
  - ``pql_query_history_audit`` — wraps ``/api/audit/history``;
    default hides audit_api rows.
  - ``pql_query_row_lineage`` — per-op row-edge aggregate
    (run-scoped, distinct from the existing soyuz table-level
    ``pql_lineage`` tool).
  - ``pql_query_column_lineage`` — column-axis JSON view.
  - ``pql_query_value_changes`` — always-masked at the
    PointlesSQL boundary; the plugin doesn't expose a cleartext
    path.
  - ``pql_query_rejects`` — Sprint-15.5.3 reject rows.
  - ``pql_query_external_writes`` — unattributed Delta commits.
  - ``pql_get_run`` was deliberately dropped — the existing
    ``pql_run_summary`` already covers it.

- **16 new pytest cases in
  ``tests/test_audit_routes_sprint_19.py``** covering the
  privilege ladder (normal/supervisor/auditor/admin against
  tenant-wide and per-run reads), the masked-by-default
  contract on ``/audit/value-changes``, the audit-of-audit
  recursion guard on ``/api/audit/history``, the
  ``query_history`` row landing for each successful per-run
  audit read, and the structural shape of the anomaly bugfix.
  ``test_api_key_gate.py`` updated for the new
  ``parse_keys`` triple shape and gains a
  ``test_parse_keys_supports_auditor_scope`` case.
  Pre-existing unrelated test failures in
  ``test_api_notebook_workspace.py`` /
  ``test_scheduler_papermill.py`` /
  ``test_table_stats.py`` are untouched (verified clean on
  HEAD prior to this change).

### Added — Phase 18: Audit Cockpit (2026-04-28)

Closes Phase 18 in one autonomous session — six sub-sprints landed
on top of the Phase 15.7 capture surface to make the audit data
*actionable* for the four real personas (operator on-call,
developer debug, compliance auditor, daily trust glance).
Sequencing decision: Phase 18 lands **before** Phase 17 against
today's 10-tab run-detail layout; 18.1 cross-axis links will be
re-touched once Phase 17's tab consolidation lands.

- **Sprint 18.0 — Audit-Read API backbone.**  Three read-only
  JSON endpoints feed every later cockpit, Grafana, and
  Hermes-tool surface:
  - ``GET /api/audit/summary?since&until&principal&agent_id&table``
    returns one count per metric across runs, ops, errored ops,
    rows written (merge + write_table), value changes, rejects,
    external writes, cost-gate denials, tool calls, queries.
  - ``GET /api/audit/timeseries?metric&bin&group_by&...``
    bins by hour/day/week with optional grouping by table or
    principal.
  - ``GET /api/audit/anomalies?metric&window_days&sigma&...``
    classifies each bin against an N-day rolling mean ± Nσ as
    ``ok`` / ``warn`` (≥σ) / ``critical`` (≥2σ).
  - Backed by a new ``audit_aggregator`` service with a single
    ``_apply_audit_filters`` helper so the WHERE-clause logic
    lives in one place.  Dialect-aware bucketing (SQLite
    ``strftime`` vs Postgres ``date_trunc``) keeps both
    deployments working.
  - Self-tracking: every successful call inserts a
    ``query_history`` row with ``read_kind='audit_api'`` so the
    cockpit endpoints land in the audit lake they query.
    ``audit_api`` was added to ``VALID_READ_KINDS``.
  - All three endpoints are admin-gated.

- **Sprint 18.1 — Cross-axis navigation.**  The Operations-tab
  ``column edges: N`` and ``value changes: N`` badges now wrap
  in deep-links to ``/runs/{id}?op_id=N#tab-lineage``.  The
  ``run_detail_page`` handler accepts ``?op_id=`` and threads it
  into ``_load_operations_for_run`` /
  ``_load_rejects_for_run`` / ``_load_lineage_summary_for_run``
  so the three cross-axis tabs render filtered to that single
  op.  A "filtered to op #N" chip with a Clear-filter button
  sits above the tab strip.  Stale ``op_id`` falls back to
  unfiltered rendering rather than 404 (drill-downs are
  permissive).

- **Sprint 18.2 — PII-aware masking.**  New
  ``pointlessql/services/pii_resolver.py`` resolves column-level
  PII tags from soyuz-catalog (``GET /tags/column/{fqn.col}``)
  with a TTL cache keyed on ``(table, column)`` so a row-trace
  page rendering 100 cells from one table issues at most one
  soyuz call.  ``pii_mask`` helper replaces cleartext with
  ``***@***.***`` (email) / ``***-***-1234`` (phone) /
  ``A***z`` (default) shapes.  Row-trace template renders
  ``display_old`` / ``display_new`` (masked when
  ``is_pii=True``) and shows a Reveal button to admins;
  ``POST /api/audit/pii/reveal`` returns the cleartext and
  writes an ``audit_log`` row of
  ``action='pii.value_revealed'``.  ``AuditSettings`` gained
  ``pii_mask_default`` (default ``True``) and
  ``pii_cache_ttl_seconds`` (default ``600``).  Storage stays
  byte-faithful — masking is render-time only.

- **Sprint 18.3 — Saved audit queries + CSV/JSON export.**  New
  ``saved_audit_queries`` table (Alembic ``j0e1f2a3b4c5``)
  separate from ``saved_queries`` because:
  - visibility is admin-only, not the owner-+-shared model;
  - five canonical starter rows ship with the migration:
    ``pii-writes-last-90d``, ``rollbacks-last-quarter``,
    ``cost-gate-denials-this-week``,
    ``unacknowledged-external-writes``,
    ``top-mutating-principals-30d``;
  - ``alert_threshold_count`` plugs into the Sprint 18.5 alert
    surface;
  - service enforces an explicit allow-list of audit-table
    names (``agent_runs``, ``agent_run_operations``,
    ``lineage_*``, ``query_history``, ``audit_log``,
    ``unattributed_writes``, …) via sqlglot — SELECT-only,
    no DDL/DML.
  - CRUD endpoints at ``/api/saved-audit-queries`` plus
    ``/{slug}/run`` and ``/{slug}/export.csv`` /
    ``/{slug}/export.json`` (PDF deferred — CSV+JSON satisfy
    SOC2 / GDPR Art. 30 evidence packets).
  - Every export writes a ``saved_audit_query.exported`` audit
    row.  Starter rows refuse PATCH/DELETE.
  - New admin-only ``/audit/queries`` HTML workbench: split-
    pane list-of-queries + textarea + Run/Export buttons +
    result table.

- **Sprint 18.4 — Run-diff lineage view.**  New service
  ``run_diff.build_lineage_diff(factory, run_a_id, run_b_id)``
  produces three buckets:
  - ``reject_pattern_shift`` — counts of
    ``LineageRowReject.reason`` values per side, plus a
    per-reason ``delta``;
  - ``value_change_volume_per_table`` — per-target counts;
  - ``row_count_delta_per_table`` — sum of ``rows_affected``
    per merge / write target.

  ``GET /api/agent-runs/diff?detail=true`` carries the new
  ``lineage_diff`` payload.  New HTML route
  ``GET /runs/{a}/diff/{b}`` consumes both
  ``build_detail_diff`` and ``build_lineage_diff`` to render
  ``pages/agent_run_compare.html``: four +Δ stat cards
  (rows touched / value changes / errored ops / rejects) plus
  Chart.js bar charts for each lineage axis.

- **Sprint 18.5 — Anomaly highlighting.**  Three surfaces all
  driven by the Sprint 18.0 ``/api/audit/anomalies`` endpoint:
  - ``/api/home/summary`` carries an ``anomalies: {warn, critical}``
    block computed against ``rejects``, ``errored_ops``, and
    ``external_writes``; the home page renders a yellow/red
    banner when ≥1 metric is critical/warn.
  - ``/runs/{id}`` HTML adds an anomaly chip at the top of the
    page when the latest day's value for any of those metrics
    breaches the configured σ threshold; the chip names the
    worst-offender metric + observed-vs-baseline values.
  - ``saved_audit_queries.alert_threshold_count`` (new column)
    plugs into the existing ``/api/alerts`` machinery so a
    scheduled run that returns more rows than the threshold
    fires.

  ``AuditSettings`` gained ``anomaly_baseline_window_days``
  (default 7) and ``anomaly_threshold_sigma`` (default 2.0).
  Anomalies are computed on-the-fly — no
  ``audit_anomalies_daily`` materialised table.  Email-digest
  CLI deliberately deferred to Phase 19.2 (Audit-Reviewer-Agent
  covers daily-summary territory; building it twice is waste).

Tests: 72 new unit + integration tests across
``tests/test_audit_aggregator.py``,
``tests/test_runs_op_filter.py``,
``tests/test_pii_resolver.py``,
``tests/test_saved_audit_queries.py``,
``tests/test_run_diff_lineage.py``, and
``tests/test_anomaly_highlighting.py``.  Existing
``test_lineage_*`` and ``test_value_change_*`` suites still
pass — no regressions in the 15.x axes.

### Added — Sprint 19.0: Grafana audit dashboard (XS quick-win, 2026-04-28)

First Phase-19 sub-sprint, landed out of phase order.  Strategic
ordering note in ROADMAP marks 19.0 as eligible to land before
Phase 17 / 18 because it reads the existing audit + lineage tables
directly — no Phase-18 audit-API dependency.  Phases 19.1–19.3
remain queued (they wrap the not-yet-built Phase-18 backbone).

Goal: glance-trust dashboard.  No agent code, no API changes — a
``docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.grafana.yml up``
spins up Grafana auto-provisioned with eight panels covering
runs/day, reject-rate vs 7-day baseline, value-change-volume per
table (red ≥1000), external-write count (red ≥1), top mutating
principals, cost-gate denials, tool-call latency table, and
EXPLAIN-cost histogram.

- ``docker-compose.grafana.yml`` overlay adds a
  ``grafana/grafana-oss:latest`` service.  Two intentional config
  choices that surfaced in the design pass:
  - ``GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS=frser-sqlite-datasource``
    is **mandatory** — the SQLite plugin is unsigned and Grafana
    refuses to load it without the explicit allow.  Skipping it
    is the #2 cause of "datasource doesn't appear" reports.
  - ``pointlessql_data:/data/pointlessql`` is mounted **read-write**,
    NOT ``:ro``.  Reason: the app runs SQLite in WAL mode (the
    ``.db-wal`` and ``.db-shm`` files exist alongside the DB);
    the SQLite library needs write access to manage ``-shm`` even
    for readers.  A ``:ro`` bind produces ``disk I/O error`` on
    the first query.  The Grafana plugin only issues SELECTs.
- ``grafana/provisioning/datasources/pointlessql.yml`` pins the
  datasource UID to ``pointlessql-sqlite`` so panel→datasource
  bindings survive reprovisioning.  Without a hardcoded UID,
  every restart shuffles UIDs and breaks every panel.
- ``grafana/provisioning/dashboards/pointlessql.yml`` provider
  drops the dashboard into a ``PointlesSQL`` folder (keeps it
  out of Grafana's default ``General`` folder where built-in
  samples live), ``allowUiUpdates: false`` enforces JSON as
  the source of truth.
- ``grafana/dashboards/pointlessql_audit.json`` — 10 panels
  (8 spec'd + Markdown header + datasource-health smoke).  Layout
  on a 24×32 grid.  Notable per-panel choices:
  - **Runs/day**: timeseries-bar grouped by ``date(started_at)``,
    using the frser plugin's ``$__timeFilter()`` macro (bare
    ``$__timeFrom()`` / ``$__timeTo()`` is **not** supported).
  - **Reject-rate vs baseline**: two series, today's daily count
    plus a 7-day trailing average computed via correlated
    subquery (no SQL window functions — the frser plugin's query
    parser truncates them in some Grafana releases).
  - **Value-change-volume per table**: stacked bars per
    ``target_table``, threshold style ``line`` at 1000 to make
    over-budget runs visually pop.
  - **External-write count**: stat panel reading
    ``unattributed_writes WHERE acknowledged_at IS NULL``,
    threshold red at ≥1.
  - **Top-mutating-principals**: horizontal bars of summed
    ``rows_affected`` for ``op_name IN ('merge', 'write_table')``.
    NULL principals coalesced to ``'<unknown>'`` so background
    agents are still visible.
  - **Tool-call latency**: SQLite has no ``percentile_cont``,
    so the panel emits raw rows and a Grafana ``Reduce →
    percentile`` transform computes p50/p99 client-side.
  - **EXPLAIN-cost histogram**: ``CAST(cost_est AS REAL)`` is
    mandatory because ``cost_est`` is ``Decimal(18,4)`` ORM-side
    and the frser plugin returns Decimals as strings, which the
    histogram viz can't bucket.
- Scope decisions baked into the sprint:
  - **SQLite-only.**  Postgres deferred to Sprint 19.0.1 (separate
    overlay, separate dashboard).  Reason: dialect divergence
    (no ``percentile_cont`` / ``date_trunc`` in SQLite) makes
    a templated dual-mode dashboard cost more than the XS
    sizing allows.
  - **Panel thresholds only, no alert routing.**  Webhook /
    Slack / email routing is Phase 19.2 territory.
  - **Anonymous viewer enabled**, admin password still
    enforced for edits.

End-to-end smoke (against the host's live DB, ten queries):
all 10 panel SQLs parse cleanly and return expected shape —
``agent_runs`` has 7 rows, ``lineage_row_rejects`` 58, the
7-day baseline subquery returns 8.29 rejects/day, three
mutating principals (admin@local with 206 rows leading).

### Added — Phase 16: First-Class Rollback (closed 2026-04-27)

Closes the audit→action loop.  Phases 13–15.7 captured the audit
data plane across five lineage axes; Phase 16 adds the missing
governance primitive: a single ``pql.rollback`` call (and matching
``/runs/{id}`` button) that undoes the changes one run made to one
target Delta table.

Per AskUserQuestion 2026-04-27 the original "Delta-Branching +
first-class Rollback" sketch **splits**: Phase 16 ships rollback
only (4 sub-sprints, audit→action loop closed); Delta-Branching
becomes Phase 16.5, blocked on a ``_delta_log/`` shallow-clone
spike that deltalake-python 1.5.0 doesn't expose first-class.

Sprint 16.0 — Housekeeping:

- Alembic ``i9d0e1f2a3b4`` extends
  ``ck_agent_run_operations_op_name`` to include ``'rollback'``.
- ``VALID_OP_NAMES`` in
  ``pointlessql/services/agent_runs/operations.py`` updated.
- ``RollbackError`` family added (``RollbackTargetNotFound``,
  ``RollbackAmbiguous``, ``RollbackInvalid``, ``RollbackStale``)
  for the four refusal modes the rollback primitive surfaces.
- ``_emit_lineage_after_commit`` skips ``op_name="rollback"``
  ops — restored rows are pre-existing, no row-id mapping is
  meaningful.

Sprint 16.1 — ``pql.rollback`` primitive:

- ``pointlessql/pql/_rollback.py`` wraps the verified
  ``DeltaTable.restore(target_version, ...)`` API.  Atomic, writes
  a new commit (CDF-safe), takes a ``CommitProperties.custom_metadata``
  dict that stamps the rollback's commit log with
  ``pointlessql.rollback_of_run`` / ``pointlessql.rollback_of_op_id``.
- All four refusal gates (target-not-found / ambiguous / invalid /
  stale) fire *before* the ``restore`` call, so any refusal leaves
  Delta state untouched.
- ``pql.rollback`` is the public method on the ``PQL`` class.
- 8 tests in ``tests/test_rollback_primitive.py``.

Sprint 16.2 — Cascade detection + preview API:

- ``pointlessql/services/cascade.py`` exports
  ``find_downstream_tables(source_table)`` — walks
  ``lineage_row_edges`` + ``lineage_column_map`` and reports
  distinct downstream targets aggregated across both axes.
- ``GET /api/runs/{run_id}/rollback-preview?target=<fqn>`` returns
  version delta, staleness flag, intervening-writes list,
  multi-op ``op_candidates``, and downstream warnings.  Admin-only.
- 11 tests in ``tests/test_rollback_preview.py``.

Sprint 16.3 — Rollback UI + CloudEvent + replay:

- Rollback card on ``/runs/{id}`` (admin-only): target dropdown,
  preview modal, stale-checkbox gate, downstream warning panel,
  multi-op ordinal picker.  Modal fetches
  ``/rollback-preview`` JSON; submit posts to
  ``POST /api/runs/{run_id}/rollback`` and redirects to the new
  rollback run.
- ``POST /api/runs/{run_id}/rollback`` spawns a fresh
  ``agent_runs`` row, invokes ``pql.rollback`` on a worker thread,
  marks the run ``succeeded`` on completion (or ``failed`` with
  ``denied_reason`` when a refusal fires).  Refusal-to-HTTP map:
  ``RollbackTargetNotFound`` → 404, ``RollbackAmbiguous`` → 422,
  ``RollbackInvalid`` → 422, ``RollbackStale`` → 422.
- New CloudEvent type ``pointlessql.rollback.executed`` joins
  ``AGENT_RUN_EVENT_TYPES`` — no migration needed (existing CHECK
  is on ``outcome``, not event_type).
- ``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/rollback.md`` covers happy + stale paths
  in headful Firefox plus a refusal-mode CLI smoke matrix.
- 6 route tests in ``tests/test_rollback_route.py``.

### Changed — ROADMAP compression: archive completed phases 0-12.8 + 12.10-13.5 (2026-04-27)

`ROADMAP.md` had grown to 5685 lines, dominated by per-sprint
detail of long-completed phases that no current conversation
references.  Compressed to 1983 lines (-65%) by:

- Collapsing **Phases 0–12.8** into a one-line-per-phase summary
  table at the top of the active roadmap.
- Collapsing **Phases 12.10–13.5** into a second summary table
  immediately after Phase 12.9 (which stays full-detail because
  it's `🔜 in progress`).
- Moving the full per-sprint detail of all collapsed phases
  into a new [`ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md`](ROADMAP_ARCHIVE.md) file
  (3797 lines, append-only).
- Keeping **Phases 14–15.7** (recently closed, last ~30 days)
  at full detail because they're load-bearing for follow-up
  conversations.
- Keeping **Phases 16–20**, **Some-day**, **Icebox**, and the
  out-of-scope footer at full detail.

`CLAUDE.md` updated to mention the archive convention.  The
"How to update this file" section in `ROADMAP.md` now describes
the collapse trigger (>2000 lines or >3 months no-reference)
so future sessions know how and when to roll out further
phases.

No code change.

### Changed — Roadmap expansion: Phase 17-20 + Some-day rewrite (2026-04-27)

Strategic conversation post-15.7-close generated a substantial
roadmap extension covering the *non-capture* side of audit
infrastructure: navigation, exploration, governance UX,
forensics, distribution.  Previously the roadmap stopped at
Phase 16 (Rollback) with a vague Some-day block; it now reads
through Phase 20 with concrete sub-sprints.

- **Phase 17 — UI Overhaul**: two-column sidebar, run-detail
  tabs consolidation (10→4), lineage-DAG view (cytoscape.js),
  table-detail entdichten, catalog-browser search/filter.
- **Phase 18 — Audit Cockpit**: three new ``/api/audit/*``
  endpoints (summary / timeseries / anomalies) feed cross-axis
  navigation, PII-aware masking, saved audit queries, run-diff
  view, anomaly highlighting.
- **Phase 19 — Audit-Reviewer Agent + Grafana**: shared
  Phase-18 backbone drives a Grafana dashboard JSON
  (``grafana/pointlessql_audit.json``), 10 audit-read tools in
  ``hermes-plugin-pointlessql``, daily Audit-Reviewer-Agent
  reference run, Compliance-Bot + Incident-Responder demos.
- **Phase 20 — Forensics + Retention**: CloudTrail / audit-
  stream forwarder, PII detection + masking layer, lineage
  retention policies, time-travel value queries in UI, soyuz
  columnLineage / valueChange facet ingest (formerly the
  Phase-15.8+ sketch).
- **Some-day rewrite**: pre-OSS-release hygiene (EUIPO
  trademarks, NOTICE, CLA, domains) + big-bang launch day
  (HN / Twitter / Reddit / LinkedIn / blog) + conference
  circuit (DataCouncil, Subsurface, dbt Coalesce, Berlin
  Buzzwords, Big Data LDN) + sustained visibility + the
  original GHCR / PyPI / Helm / docs items + commercial
  offering pathway (3-5 design partners → UG/GmbH →
  cryptographic anchor service / hosted Cloud).

No code change in this entry — pure roadmap edit.  Engineering
work continues against the new tree.  See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

### Added — Phase 15.7: Value-Level Lineage (2026-04-26)

Fourth lineage axis after row (Phase 15), reject (15.5),
column (15.6).  Answers *"this gold row's `revenue` is $1234 —
what was it last week, and which run changed it?"*.  Surface
scope is `pql.merge(strategy="upsert")` only — the only PQL
primitive that mutates rows in place.

Capture mechanic: every new Delta write enables Change Data Feed
(`delta.enableChangeDataFeed=true`).  When the caller opts in via
`pql.merge(track_value_changes=True)`, post-merge
`DeltaTable.load_cdf()` yields native preimage/postimage pairs;
we diff per-cell on `_lineage_row_id` and persist into a new
`lineage_value_changes` table.  PointlesSQL-only storage; opt-in
default-off; `MAX_VALUE_CHANGES_PER_OP = 100_000` cap with
`[lineage_value_partial]` audit-row marker.

Sub-sprints:

- **15.7.0** — Open Phase 15.7 in ROADMAP / CHANGELOG (7b42369).
- **15.7.1** — Alembic migration `h8c9d0e1f2a3` adds
  `lineage_value_changes` table.  ORM `LineageValueChange`
  with `Text`-typed `old_value` / `new_value` columns.
  `record_value_changes` / `count_value_changes_for_op` /
  `fetch_value_changes_for_row` service helpers.
  `OperationRecorder.pending_value_changes` post-commit hook
  with `[lineage_value_partial]` marker (6641ed2).
- **15.7.2** — `pointlessql/pql/_cdf.py` exposes
  `cdf_creation_config()` and `ensure_cdf_enabled()`.
  `pql.write_table` (create-path) and `pql.autoload`
  (first-write) call `ensure_cdf_enabled` so every new Delta
  table records CDF events going forward (acb9954).
- **15.7.3** — `pql.merge` gains `track_value_changes` kwarg.
  Pure-function `services/value_change_capture.extract_value_changes`
  pairs `update_preimage` / `update_postimage` events on
  `_lineage_row_id` and emits one `ValueChangeSpec` per changed
  cell.  SCD-2 logs warning and skips (31847dd).
- **15.7.4** — `GET /api/lineage/value-changes?table=&row_id=
  &column=` JSON.  Row-trace page gains collapsible
  "Value changes (N)" per step.  Run-detail Operations tab
  shows `value changes: N` counter (fb8fcb2).
- **15.7.5** — `notebooks/hermes_medallion.py` silver `pql.merge`
  gets `track_value_changes=True`; second cell tweaks one
  `unit_price` and re-runs the merge.  Live replay confirmed:
  exactly 1 value-change in DB (`unit_price` 2.5 → 2.51),
  API + row-trace + run-view counter all render correctly.

### Added — Phase 15.6: Column-Level Lineage (2026-04-26)

Orthogonal column dimension to the row-lineage Phase 15 / 15.5
already shipped.  Every PQL primitive now populates a new
`lineage_column_map` table that answers *"if I rename `unit_price`
in silver, which gold columns break?"*.  PointlesSQL-only storage
(soyuz columnLineage facet ingest deferred to Phase 15.8+).
Volume bounded by schema breadth: ~52 column edges for the
canonical Hermes-Medallion run vs the 102 row edges + 2 rejects
Phase 15.5 already accepts.

- **Sprint 15.6.1** — new `lineage_column_map` table (Alembic
  `g7b8c9d0e1f2`) parented on the 15.5.3 rejects table.
  CHECK-constrained `transform_kind` enum:
  `identity` / `rename` / `derived` / `aggregate` /
  `unknown_origin` / `sql_select` / `sql_function` /
  `sql_unknown`.  Indices on (target_table, target_column),
  (source_table, source_column), run_id, op_id.  Service helpers
  `record_column_edges` (with a 1000-edge per-op cap that returns
  a `ColumnEdgeCapExceeded` sentinel and stamps
  `[lineage_column_partial]` on the audit row), `walk_back_columns`
  (column-trace walkback mirroring the Sprint-15.5.2 fan-in
  shape), and `count_column_edges_for_op`.  Best-effort
  post-commit hook on `OperationRecorder.pending_column_edges`
  matching the row-lineage / rejects contract.
- **Sprint 15.6.2** — every declarative PQL primitive populates
  the new table:
  - `pql.aggregate`: `aggs` dict drives the `aggregate` edges
    (with the agg-fn name in `transform_detail`); `group_by`
    columns become identity edges; new `derivations={...}` kwarg
    captures upstream `.assign(...)` mappings as `derived` edges
    with chain detail (e.g. `via 'line_revenue' →
    sum('line_revenue')`).
  - `pql.merge` / `pql.write_table`: schema-diff against the
    source frame.  Identity edges for surviving columns;
    `_lineage_row_id` rewritten to a `derived` edge with
    `transform_detail="synth_target_row_id"` so the row-id
    origin chain is queryable from `lineage_column_map` alone.
    `derivations` kwarg honoured; no `source_table_fqn` skips
    edge emission quietly.
  - `pql.autoload`: post-append Delta schema reads — non-audit
    columns recorded as `unknown_origin` with detail =
    `source_volume_fqn` or `"file"`; audit columns recorded as
    `unknown_origin` with detail `"audit"`.
  - New `services/column_lineage_diff.infer_column_edges` helper
    encapsulates the merge/write_table/autoload classification.
- **Sprint 15.6.3** — `pql.sql` populates the table for SELECT
  projections via `sqlglot.lineage`.  Per output column:
  bare-column refs → `sql_select`, function/arithmetic/CASE →
  `sql_function` (with rendered subexpression as
  `transform_detail`), zero-downstream nodes (`count(*)`, window
  functions, lateral joins) → `sql_unknown`.  Schema dict built
  from DuckDB `DESCRIBE` against the already-registered Delta
  views — no soyuz round-trip at SQL time.  Synthetic
  `target_table="query"` since `pql.sql` results aren't
  persisted; op_id is the unique discriminator.
- **Sprint 15.6.4** — three UI surfaces around the walkback:
  - `GET /api/lineage/column-trace?table=&column=` JSON +
    `/catalogs/.../columns/{col}/trace` HTML page (`column_trace.html`)
    with colour-coded transform_kind badges, fan-in collapsibles,
    click-through to source columns.
  - Table-detail page renders a small "lineage" badge per column
    that has at least one `lineage_column_map` row.
  - Run-detail Operations tab adds a "column edges: N" badge per
    op that produced edges (no new tab; same shape as the 15.5.4
    rejects counter).
- **Sprint 15.6.5** — `notebooks/hermes_medallion.py` declares
  `derivations={"placed_day": ["placed_at"], "line_revenue":
  ["qty", "unit_price"]}` on the gold aggregate.  Live E2E
  replay (headful Firefox): two notebook runs against fresh
  schemas, 52 column edges total, column-trace API walks
  `revenue → (qty, unit_price)` and `placed_day → placed_at` to
  bronze, table-detail page shows lineage badges on all five
  gold columns, run-detail tab shows `column edges: 10/10/6` per
  op.  Console clean.

### Added — Phase 15.5: Aggregate Lineage + Reject Visibility (2026-04-26)

Closes the two row-lineage gaps the Phase-15 live replay surfaced.
Five sprints landed in one autonomous session, all with green
linters + unit tests + a headful Firefox walkthrough that exercised
every UI surface end-to-end.

- **Sprint 15.5.1** — new `pql.aggregate()` primitive with fan-in
  lineage emission.  Records one edge per (source row, target group)
  pair so gold tables become trace-able back to their silver
  sources.  `source_table_fqn` is required (fail-fast).
  `_lineage_row_id` synth via SHA-256(target || group_values) so
  re-runs reuse target IDs deterministically.  See the new
  `pointlessql/pql/_aggregate.py` module and the matching
  Alembic migration `e5f6a7b8c9d0` extending the
  `agent_run_operations.op_name` CHECK by `'aggregate'`.
- **Sprint 15.5.2** — `walk_back` returns predecessors per step.
  The row-trace UI surfaces fan-in as a collapsible
  "Aggregated from N source rows" block with click-through to each
  source row's own trace page.  Chain recursion still picks oldest
  for determinism.
- **Sprint 15.5.3** — opt-in `pql.merge(track_rejects=True)` records
  source rows that won't land in the target into a new
  `lineage_row_rejects` table (Alembic `f6a7b8c9d0e1`).  Reasons:
  `on_key_null` / `duplicate_in_source` (auto-detected pre-merge),
  `schema_mismatch` / `merge_predicate_excluded` / `other` (enum
  reserved for callers).
- **Sprint 15.5.4** — new "Rejects" tab on the run-detail page
  between Operations and Tool calls.  Counter badge in the tab
  label, reason badges per row (color-coded), click-throughs from
  rejected source-row IDs to the row-trace page.  Empty state
  explains "track_rejects=True not set on any merge call".
- **Sprint 15.5.5** — notebook + fixture migrated; live E2E replay
  produced 102 lineage edges across 2 ops + 2 rejects + a 24-source
  fan-in on a gold row, verified in headful Firefox with 0 console
  errors.  Caught and fixed a Jinja-filter bug
  (`format_datetime` doesn't exist) that linters never had a chance
  to flag — the replay-as-gate memo proves itself again.

### Fixed — Sprint 15.5.0: Phase-15 bugfix landing (2026-04-26)

Two bugs surfaced in the Phase-15 live E2E replay (headful Firefox
walkthrough of the medallion notebook).  Neither could be caught by
ruff / pyright / pydoclint — they required running the full ETL +
clicking through the UI.  Reinforces the "live replay as gate" memo.

- **Fixed** [`pointlessql/models/lineage.py`](pointlessql/models/lineage.py)
  + [`pointlessql/alembic/versions/d4e5f6a7b8c9_lineage_row_edges.py`](pointlessql/alembic/versions/d4e5f6a7b8c9_lineage_row_edges.py)
  — `lineage_row_edges.id` switched from `BigInteger` to `Integer`
  primary key.  Only `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` autoincrements in SQLite;
  `BIGINT PRIMARY KEY` does not.  Symptom: every `pql.merge` stamped
  `[lineage_edges_partial] IntegrityError("NOT NULL constraint failed:
  lineage_row_edges.id")` on `agent_run_operations.error_message` and
  produced zero per-row edges.
- **Fixed** [`frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html`](frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html)
  — header link "View lineage graph" URL aligned with the rest of the
  codebase: `/catalogs/{cat}/{schema}/{table}` →
  `/catalogs/{cat}/schemas/{schema}/tables/{table}`.  Line 594 of the
  same template was already correct; line 87 was a copy-paste miss.

### Added — Sprint 15.4: Row-trace UI + run-detail Lineage tab (2026-04-26)

Closes Phase 15.  The lineage chain built by Sprints 15.1-15.3 is
now navigable in the browser: an agent or reviewer can take any
silver row, click its `_lineage_row_id`, and walk the edges back to
the originating bronze cell with the source filename attached.

- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/lineage_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/lineage_routes.py)
  with two endpoints:
  - `GET /api/lineage/row-trace?table=&row_id=` — JSON walkback via
    `services.lineage_edges.walk_back` (capped at 20 hops).  When
    the deepest step lands on a bronze table, opens the Delta table
    via deltalake + DuckDB and looks up the `_source_file` cell so
    the trace can label "this row came from `orders.csv`".
  - `GET /catalogs/{cat}/schemas/{sch}/tables/{tbl}/rows/{row_id}/trace`
    — HTML page rendering the same walkback as a Bootstrap
    list-group (one card per step with depth badge, table FQN,
    op-name badge, and a link to the originating run).
- **Updated** [`pointlessql/api/main.py`](pointlessql/api/main.py)
  registers `lineage_router` **before** `governance_router` so the
  exact-match `/api/lineage/row-trace` route wins over the existing
  `/api/lineage/{full_name:path}` catch-all (which would otherwise
  greedy-capture `"row-trace"` as a UC full name).
- **Added** [`frontend/templates/pages/row_trace.html`](frontend/templates/pages/row_trace.html)
  rendering the input row metadata, the walkback steps, and an
  "lineage break" badge when the chain stops at depth 0 (no
  predecessor edges recorded).
- **Updated** [`frontend/templates/components/lineage_card.html`](frontend/templates/components/lineage_card.html)
  the card now accepts an optional `table_columns` context list and
  renders a card-footer hint when `_lineage_row_id` is present;
  also drops an `<a id="lineage">` anchor so the run-detail
  "View lineage graph" deep-link from Sprint 15.1 lands at the card.
- **Updated** [`frontend/templates/pages/table.html`](frontend/templates/pages/table.html)
  passes the table's column names to `lineage_card`; the Alpine
  preview now renders `_lineage_row_id` cells as deep-links to the
  row-trace page (truncated display, full UUID in the URL).
- **Updated** [`frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html`](frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html)
  new "Lineage" tab between "UC mutations" and "Queries" lists each
  op that produced edges with source/target FQNs and edge count;
  links into the target's lineage card via the new `#lineage`
  anchor.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/runs_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/runs_routes.py)
  `_load_lineage_summary_for_run()` joins `lineage_row_edges`
  against `agent_run_operations` for the run-detail Lineage tab,
  returning `{total_edges, rows: [{ordinal, op_name, source_table,
  target_table, edge_count}]}`.

### Added — Sprint 15.3: `lineage_row_edges` shadow table + merge instrumentation (2026-04-26)

Third Phase-15 sprint.  Per-row provenance now closes the loop: a
silver row produced by `pql.merge` carries a deterministic
`_lineage_row_id` that joins to a `lineage_row_edges` row pointing
back at the bronze cell that fed it.  Sprint 15.4 will surface this
in the UI.

- **Added** Alembic migration `d4e5f6a7b8c9` creating
  [`lineage_row_edges`](pointlessql/alembic/versions/d4e5f6a7b8c9_lineage_row_edges.py)
  (`run_id` FK to `agent_runs.id`, `op_id` FK to
  `agent_run_operations.id`, `source_table`, `source_row_id`,
  `target_table`, `target_row_id`, `created_at` plus four indexes
  for the lookup patterns Sprint 15.4 needs).  No UNIQUE constraint
  — re-merges of the same rows produce fresh edges with new
  `op_id`s, preserving merge history as an audit signal.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/models/lineage.py`](pointlessql/models/lineage.py)
  `LineageRowEdge` ORM model (re-exported from `pointlessql.models`).
- **Added** [`pointlessql/services/lineage_edges.py`](pointlessql/services/lineage_edges.py)
  with the public surface used by the merge/write instrumentation
  and Sprint 15.4's UI:
  - `synth_target_row_id(source_id, target_table) ->`
    `SHA-256("<source_id>:<target_table>")` — deterministic +
    table-distinct so re-runs reuse target IDs while never
    collapsing across tables.
  - `record_edges(...)` — best-effort bulk INSERT, returns the
    underlying exception on failure for the marker hook.
  - `fetch_target_row_predecessors` / `fetch_source_row_descendants`
    / `walk_back(table, row_id, max_hops=20)` — Sprint-15.4-bound
    read API.
  - `lookup_bronze_source_file(table, row_id, storage_location)` —
    DuckDB-over-deltalake one-row probe so the deepest walkback
    step can label its bronze origin file.
  - `count_edges_for_op(op_ids)` — UI counts per operation.
- **Added** `OperationRecorder.pending_lineage_edges` (kept off
  `params_json` so 100k-row payloads don't pollute the audit row)
  on
  [`pointlessql/services/agent_runs/operations.py`](pointlessql/services/agent_runs/operations.py).
  New post-commit hook `_record_row_edges_after_commit()` reads the
  payload, calls `record_edges`, and stamps
  `[lineage_edges_partial]` onto `agent_run_operations.error_message`
  on failure (refactored marker stamping into
  `_stamp_audit_marker` shared with Sprint-15.1's emit hook).
- **Updated** [`pointlessql/pql/_merge.py`](pointlessql/pql/_merge.py)
  new `_prepare_lineage()` helper extracts source row IDs from the
  PyArrow source's `_lineage_row_id` column (when present),
  synthesises target IDs via `synth_target_row_id`, and rebuilds
  the column so the target table's row inherits the new ID.  Empty
  ID lists when the source has no lineage column — the chain just
  stops there.  `pending_lineage_edges` is set only when both the
  source carried IDs **and** the caller declared `source_table_fqn`.
- **Updated** [`pointlessql/pql/_write.py`](pointlessql/pql/_write.py)
  parallel `_stamp_lineage_for_write()` works on pandas
  DataFrames or PyArrow Tables (the two engine-native frame shapes
  the writer accepts) and threads the source/target IDs through to
  the recorder for the same post-commit edge insert.

### Added — Sprint 15.2: Bronze `_lineage_row_id` audit column (2026-04-26)

Second Phase-15 sprint.  Bronze rows now carry a stable per-row
identity that downstream silver/gold transformations can reference
to walk the trail back to the originating cell.

- **Updated** [`pointlessql/conventions/_defaults.py`](pointlessql/conventions/_defaults.py)
  the bronze `LayerConvention` gains a fourth required audit column
  `_lineage_row_id` (alongside `_ingested_at`, `_source_file`,
  `_source_system`).  Other layers stay unchanged — silver/gold
  inherit lineage IDs through the merge primitive (Sprint 15.3) and
  don't get them injected at write time.
- **Updated** [`pointlessql/pql/_autoload.py`](pointlessql/pql/_autoload.py)
  `_inject_audit_columns()` now accepts `file_sha` and computes
  `_lineage_row_id` per row as
  `SHA-256("<file_sha>:<row_offset>")`.  The new helper
  `_row_lineage_id(file_sha, offset)` exposes the same construction
  for tests and downstream tooling.  The autoload caller threads
  the file SHA it already has from the dedup checkpoint into the
  injection call — no extra hashing pass.
- The change is a **convention**, not a schema migration: existing
  bronze tables keep their schema until the next autoload appends
  to them, at which point deltalake adds the new column with NULL
  for the older rows.  Re-running an autoload over the same file is
  a no-op (existing checkpoint dedup) and the IDs are deterministic
  so any future re-ingest produces identical row IDs.

### Added — Sprint 15.1: PQL → soyuz OpenLineage emission (2026-04-26)

First Phase-15 sprint.  Every successful PQL primitive call inside an
agent run now emits one OpenLineage `RunEvent` to soyuz so the
table-level lineage graph (`lineage_runs` + `lineage_edges`) auto-
populates without the operator having to wire OpenLineage producers
manually.

- **Added** [`pointlessql/services/soyuz_lineage.py`](pointlessql/services/soyuz_lineage.py)
  `emit_event_sync(run_id, op_name, inputs, outputs, event_type)`
  builds an `OpenLineageEvent` (using the typed soyuz client's
  generated models) and POSTs it through the existing
  `make_soyuz_client(agent_run_id=...)` factory.  The PointlesSQL
  `agent_run_id` is reused verbatim as the OpenLineage `runId` —
  soyuz strips hyphens to derive `LineageRun.id`, so cross-
  referencing agent runs ↔ lineage runs needs no extra mapping
  table.  The helper is **best-effort**: any underlying exception
  (connection refused, 5xx, timeout) is returned to the caller
  rather than raised, so the write that already committed is never
  rolled back by a downstream lineage hiccup.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/services/agent_runs/operations.py`](pointlessql/services/agent_runs/operations.py)
  `_emit_lineage_after_commit()` is invoked from `operation_context`
  after the success-path `record_operation()` returns.  Inputs are
  derived per-op:
  - `autoload` — empty (filesystem source, no UC securable)
  - `merge` / `write_table` — `extra_params["source_table_fqn"]`
    when the caller declared one, otherwise empty
  - `sql` — `params_json["referenced_tables"]` from the SQL parser
  Outputs default to `recorder.target_table` (or empty for read-only
  SELECTs).  When both lists are empty the emission is skipped.
  Failures stamp `[lineage_emit_failed] <repr(exc)>` onto the just-
  inserted row's `error_message`.
- **Added** `source_table_fqn` kwarg to
  [`pointlessql/pql/_merge.py`](pointlessql/pql/_merge.py) /
  [`pointlessql/pql/_write.py`](pointlessql/pql/_write.py) and a
  `source_volume_fqn` kwarg to
  [`pointlessql/pql/_autoload.py`](pointlessql/pql/_autoload.py) so
  callers can declare upstream UC inputs.  Threaded through the
  public `PQL.merge()` / `PQL.write_table()` / `PQL.autoload()`
  facades on [`pointlessql/pql/pql.py`](pointlessql/pql/pql.py);
  `PQL.merge()` further auto-derives `source_table_fqn` when *source*
  is itself a UC `"catalog.schema.table"` string.
- **Updated** [`frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html`](frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html)
  the run-detail header gains a "View lineage graph" button that
  jumps to the lineage card on the first touched table's catalog
  page (deep-link via `#lineage`).

### Changed — Sprint 15.0: Phase 15 reframed as lineage completeness (2026-04-26)

- **Updated** [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) Phase-15 block: title
  shortened from "Provenance Log (data + LLM signed audit)" to
  "Lineage completeness", marker flipped ⏳ → 🚧, sub-tree
  expanded with the four sprint placeholders (15.1 OpenLineage
  emission, 15.2 bronze `_lineage_row_id`, 15.3
  `lineage_row_edges`, 15.4 row-trace UI), and an explicit Out-
  of-scope block for the Shoreguard token-trail log (lives in
  shoreguard-fresh per the boundary memo), arbitrary-SQL row
  lineage, and column-level lineage.

### Changed — Sprint 14.4 follow-up: soyuz pin bumped to v0.2.0rc3 (2026-04-26)

- **Updated** `pyproject.toml` `[tool.uv.sources]` pin from
  `v0.2.0rc2` → `v0.2.0rc3` and refreshed `uv.lock`.  The new
  soyuz tag carries the audit-log infrastructure
  (table + middleware + `/audit-log` endpoint + six instrumented
  mutation routes) plus the regenerated client with the typed
  `audit` API module.
- The Sprint 14.4 PointlesSQL service `soyuz_audit.fetch_for_run`
  still uses raw httpx; switching to the typed
  `list_audit_log_audit_log_get.asyncio(...)` method is a follow-
  up cosmetic when another callsite needs the typed surface.

### Added — Sprint 14.4: soyuz UC-mutation cross-reference (2026-04-26)

Closes the fourth and final Phase-14 audit-trail gap.  PointlesSQL
now forwards `X-Agent-Run-Id` outbound on every soyuz call made
from inside an agent run; soyuz's `audit_log` table (added
in soyuz `v0.2.0rc3`) attributes the mutation; the run-detail view
gains a "UC mutations" tab that joins them back together.

- **Added** [`pointlessql/services/soyuz_client.py`](pointlessql/services/soyuz_client.py)
  `make_soyuz_client(...)` and `make_principal_client(...)` accept
  an optional `agent_run_id` kwarg that lands as the
  `X-Agent-Run-Id` request header on every UC call the returned
  client makes.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/pql/pql.py`](pointlessql/pql/pql.py)
  `PQL.__init__` resolves the run id (explicit kwarg →
  `POINTLESSQL_AGENT_RUN_ID` env) before client construction so
  every PQL primitive's outbound UC traffic is attributable.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/services/soyuz_audit.py`](pointlessql/services/soyuz_audit.py)
  `fetch_for_run(uc_client, run_id, limit)` — read-only client for
  soyuz's `GET /audit-log?agent_run_id=` cross-reference surface,
  implemented via raw httpx (`get_async_httpx_client()`) since the
  generated client has no methods for `/audit-log` yet.  404
  collapses to `[]` so older soyuz versions degrade gracefully.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/runs_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/runs_routes.py)
  `_load_uc_mutations_for_run(request, run_id)` helper; the
  run-detail page passes `uc_mutations` into the template context.
- **Added** New "UC mutations" tab in `run_view.html` between Tool
  calls and Queries; renders action / target / principal / detail
  / created_at columns.  Empty-state copy spells out the
  `X-Agent-Run-Id` propagation contract and the soyuz `v0.2.0rc3`
  minimum.

Soyuz pin still at `v0.2.0rc2` — bumping to `v0.2.0rc3` pending a
push of the local soyuz tag.  The PointlesSQL code works against
any soyuz version: older soyuz returns 404 on `/audit-log` and the
UC mutations tab simply renders empty.

### Added — Sprint 14.3: external-write detection (2026-04-26)

Closes the third of four Phase-14 audit-trail gaps.  Delta commits
that bypassed every PQL primitive (raw `deltalake.write_deltalake()`,
Spark, `cp` of parquet, foreign tools) now surface in a dedicated
`unattributed_writes` table with a triage queue UI.  Detection-only
by design — see `project_full_autonomous_audit_critical_path.md`.

- **Added** Alembic `c3d4f5a6b7e8` — `unattributed_writes` table
  (`table_fqn` + `delta_version` UNIQUE, plus `acknowledged_at` /
  `detected_at` indexes).  Down-revision: `b27e6ad14ead`.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/services/external_write_scanner.py`](pointlessql/services/external_write_scanner.py) —
  `scan_table()` walks `DeltaTable(path).history(limit=N)` and
  diffs against `agent_run_operations.delta_version_after`;
  `scan_all()` enumerates every UC table via the async UC client;
  `list_unattributed()` / `acknowledge()` / `count_unacknowledged()`
  back the admin UI.  Reuses the
  `services/table_stats.read_delta_log_version` deltalake pattern;
  no raw `_delta_log/` JSON parsing.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/admin_external_writes_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/admin_external_writes_routes.py) —
  four admin-gated routes: GET HTML page, GET JSON list, POST scan
  trigger, POST acknowledge.
- **Added** Lifespan loop in [`pointlessql/api/main.py`](pointlessql/api/main.py)
  gated by `POINTLESSQL_EXTERNAL_WRITES_SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`
  (default `0` = disabled — single-node vServer keeps the
  `DeltaTable.history()` cost off the critical path until an admin
  opts in).
- **Added** New `ExternalWritesSettings` sub-model
  (`scan_interval_seconds`, `history_limit`).
- **Added** Run-detail Operations tab gains a warning banner with
  the first 5 unattributed writes on tables this run touched
  (acknowledged-status filter), linking to `/admin/external-writes`.

### Added — Sprint 14.2: read-audit for `pql.table()` (2026-04-26)

Closes the second of four Phase-14 audit-trail gaps — the DSGVO
"wer hat meine Daten gelesen?" question for direct-Delta read paths
that bypassed `/api/sql/execute` entirely.

- **Added** Alembic `b27e6ad14ead` — `query_history.read_kind`
  TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT `sql_execute` (down-revision:
  `a1c051a7e1ab`).  Enum validation lives in
  `record_query` against `VALID_READ_KINDS = {sql_execute,
  pql_table, engine_direct}` to match the existing
  application-level validation pattern (no DB CHECK).
- **Added** [`pointlessql/services/read_audit.py`](pointlessql/services/read_audit.py)
  `record_read()` — synthesises a `SELECT * FROM <fqn>` row so the
  existing `/queries` UI keeps working without per-`read_kind`
  branches.  Best-effort: silent passthrough when the session
  factory is unbound, swallows insert errors so audit can never
  break the read path.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/pql/_read.py`](pointlessql/pql/_read.py)
  instruments `read_table()` with a `record_read` call gated on
  `POINTLESSQL_AGENT_RUN_ID` being set, mirroring how `_sql.py`
  resolves run context.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/queries_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/queries_routes.py)
  `?read_kind=` filter on both `/queries` (HTML) and `/api/queries`
  (JSON); unknown values silently fall back to "no filter".
- **Added** Filter dropdown on `/queries`; "Kind" column with
  badge on both `/queries` and the run-detail Queries tab; empty-
  state copy mentions `pql.table()` reads explicitly.

### Added — Sprint 14.1: cost-gate EXPLAIN snapshot (2026-04-26)

Closes the first of four Phase-14 audit-trail gaps.  When the
Sprint-13.1 cost gate denies a query, reviewers can now see the
EXPLAIN plan that produced the verdict without re-running it.

- **Added** Alembic `a1c051a7e1ab` — `agent_runs.cost_gate_trigger`
  nullable JSON-as-Text column (down-revision: `b55f1020b8a4`).
- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/sql_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/sql_routes.py)
  `api_sql_explain` returns a new `cost_gate_trigger` field
  (`{explain, estimated_cost, threshold, engine, referenced_tables}`)
  in the response body when `needs_approval` is true.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py)
  `_coerce_cost_gate_trigger` helper; finish-route accepts the
  optional `cost_gate_trigger` body field; `serialize_agent_run`
  decodes it back to a dict.
- **Added** Run-detail metadata card (`run_view.html`) renders a
  collapsible Cost-gate-trigger row with badge + estimated/threshold
  numbers + EXPLAIN-JSON `<pre>` toggle (Alpine `:class` /
  `d-block`/`d-none` per `feedback_bootstrap_modal_x_show.md`).

### Changed — Sprint 14.0: Phase 14 scope split (2026-04-26)

Phase 14 in `ROADMAP.md` is now scoped exclusively to the
audit-trail completeness pass (former 14.x): cost-gate EXPLAIN
snapshot, read-audit for `pql.table()`, external-write detection,
soyuz UC-mutation cross-reference. Sprint sequence 14.1 → 14.4
fixed; cross-repo soyuz work intentionally last as the natural
synchronisation point.

The original Phase 14 public-launch track (GHCR-public flip,
PyPI publish, multi-arch builds, Helm chart, README pass) moved
to a new unscheduled `Some-day` block at the end of the roadmap
tree. License decision locked to Apache 2.0. Memory heuristic
*"Don't pre-build release engineering for one user"* (see
`feedback_release_engineering_timing.md`) gates promotion: the
block stays unscheduled until an external consumer asks.

The previously-listed *"Run-detail Tool calls UI tab"* sub-item
is dropped — already landed silently in
`frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html:235-240` during the
Sprint-13.7.4 window before the migrations squash.

Plan: `.claude/plans/plane-phase-14-komplett-floofy-nest.md`.

### Added — Sprint 13.11.11: PQL write endpoints (2026-04-26)

Closed the read-only gap on the agent's tool surface that the
2026-04-26 walkthrough surfaced — `gpt-5-mini` correctly noted
that `pql.autoload` was unreachable from the chat adapter.

- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/pql_write_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/pql_write_routes.py) —
  four `POST /api/pql/*` endpoints behind `check_privilege` +
  Sprint-13.8 forced audit trail:
  - `/autoload` — mirrors `PQL.autoload` (file → bronze).
  - `/write_table` — runs SELECT, materialises pandas, writes.
  - `/merge` — runs SELECT, upsert / SCD-2 into existing target.
  - `/drop_table` — admin-only soyuz delete passthrough.
- `write_table` + `merge` reuse `prepare_sql` +
  `register_delta_view` so SELECT-side parsing/enforcement
  stays consistent with `/api/sql/execute`.
- 9 route-level tests in
  [`tests/test_pql_write_routes.py`](tests/test_pql_write_routes.py)
  (admin happy-path, validation reject, non-admin denial per
  endpoint).

Plugin commit `hermes-plugin-pointlessql fa31742` adds the
matching four tools (`pql_autoload` / `pql_write_table` /
`pql_merge` / `pql_drop_table`) — 14 new tool tests, 80/80
pass.  Plugin tool surface now sits at 20 tools (16 + 4).

### Fixed — Sprint 13.11.5: live-Hermes hotfix

First real `hermes chat` smoke run after the Phase-13 close-out
exposed two latent bugs the unit tests couldn't catch — one
PointlesSQL-side, two on the plugin side.

- **Fixed** [`pointlessql/api/error_handlers.py`](pointlessql/api/error_handlers.py)
  `_handle_request_validation_error` — added a new `_json_safe`
  coercion helper that walks dicts/lists and decodes raw `bytes`
  to UTF-8 before returning the 422 body.  Without it a request
  posted with a JSON body but missing `Content-Type` made
  FastAPI surface the payload verbatim in the validation
  error's `input` field, and `json.dumps` then raised
  `TypeError: Object of type bytes is not JSON serializable` —
  flipping the 422 into an opaque 500.  New tests in
  [`tests/test_error_handler_json_safe.py`](tests/test_error_handler_json_safe.py)
  cover scalar pass-through, byte decoding (incl. invalid
  UTF-8 → replacement chars), nested structures, and the
  contract test that `json.dumps` round-trips cleanly.

The two plugin-side bugs (discovery shim + `Content-Type`
default + `finish_run` status default) ship in
`hermes-plugin-pointlessql 5676301`.

### Added — Sprint 13.11 walkthrough playbook

- **Added** [`docs/e2e-walkthroughs/sprint_13_11_reflexive_tools.md`](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/sprint_13_11_reflexive_tools.md)
  — API-centric replay with embedded Playwright-MCP-Befehle.
  Live-replayed 2026-04-26: all five Family-A routes return the
  expected payload, `pql_target_state(missing.table)` returns
  `exists=false` (the bug-2 catch), supervisor scope correctly
  returns `403` for the normal-key path on `/summary`, and
  `cost_gate_threshold` is **not** present in the
  supervisor-key response (anti-gaming guard verified).  The
  `/runs/{id}` UI surfaced the new tool-call-tab badge populated
  by the simulated `post_tool_call` POSTs.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.11.4b: Detailed op-by-op + tool-call diff

Extends `GET /api/agent-runs/diff` with two optional parameters
(`detail=true` and `align=ordinal|content`) that surface the
op-by-op + tool-call-by-tool-call diff alongside the
Sprint-13.11.4a summary fields.

- **Added** [`pointlessql/services/run_diff.py`](pointlessql/services/run_diff.py)
  — pure-Python diff service.  Two alignment strategies:
  `"ordinal"` zips by index, `"content"` greedy-matches on
  `(op_name, target_table)` for operations and `tool_name` for
  tool calls.  Per-pair output emits `op_name_diff` /
  `target_table_diff` / `rows_affected_diff` /
  `delta_version_after_diff` / `error_diff` / `params_diff` only
  when those fields actually differ — keeps the LLM transcript
  small.  Tool-call diffs walk top-level keys of `args_json`.
  Combined slot count capped at 500 with a `truncated` marker.
- **Extended** `GET /api/agent-runs/diff` in
  [`pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py)
  — accepts `detail: bool` + `align: ordinal|content`.  Bad
  `align` values are rejected by the FastAPI `Query(pattern=…)`
  validator with a 422.
- **Added** tests
  [`tests/test_run_diff_service.py`](tests/test_run_diff_service.py)
  (pure-unit alignment + diff coverage) and
  [`tests/test_diff_runs_route.py`](tests/test_diff_runs_route.py)
  (integration through the supervisor-Bearer auth path).

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.11.4a: DB-backed API keys + Family-B supervisor scope

API-key store promoted to a real DB table; new `supervisor` scope
gates the Sprint-13.11.4 supervisor-only routes.

- **Added** Alembic 025
  [`pointlessql/alembic/versions/025_api_keys_table.py`](pointlessql/alembic/versions/025_api_keys_table.py)
  — `api_keys` table with `(id, name, secret_hash, secret_prefix,
  supervisor, created_at, created_by_user_id, revoked_at,
  last_used_at)`. SHA-256-hex secret hashing; index on
  `secret_hash` for the hot-path verify.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/models/api_keys.py`](pointlessql/models/api_keys.py)
  ORM model + `ApiKey` re-export from `pointlessql.models`.
- **Refactored** [`pointlessql/services/api_keys.py`](pointlessql/services/api_keys.py)
  — `parse_keys` now returns `dict[str, tuple[str, bool]]` to
  carry the supervisor flag from the env-var format extension
  (`name:secret:supervisor`). `verify_bearer(authorization, factory)`
  is DB-backed with a 60s in-memory cache; `bootstrap_from_env`
  idempotently spills env-declared pairs into the table at
  startup; `create_api_key` / `revoke_api_key` / `list_api_keys`
  / `is_supervisor` / `invalidate_cache` are the new admin
  primitives.
- **Refactored** [`pointlessql/api/middleware.py`](pointlessql/api/middleware.py)
  — Bearer branch reads `request.app.state.session_factory` and
  attaches `request.state.api_key_supervisor` for the new gate.
- **Added** `require_supervisor(request)` in
  [`pointlessql/api/dependencies.py`](pointlessql/api/dependencies.py)
  — passes for cookie-admins and Bearer keys with
  `supervisor=True`; 403s otherwise.
- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/admin_api_keys_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/admin_api_keys_routes.py)
  with `GET/POST /api/admin/api-keys` and
  `POST /api/admin/api-keys/{name}/revoke`. Plaintext secret is
  returned exactly once at creation; rotations land via
  `audit()` rows.
- **Added** filter expansion on `GET /api/agent-runs`
  (`principal` / `agent_id` / `status` / `since`) +
  `GET /api/agent-runs/{id}/summary` +
  `GET /api/agent-runs/diff?a=&b=` in
  [`pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py).
  The summary deliberately omits `cost_gate_threshold`
  (anti-gaming).
- **Updated** [`docs/auth.md`](docs/auth.md) — DB-backed store as
  primary; env-var as bootstrap; admin-CRUD examples; supervisor
  scope explained.
- **Tests**:
  [`tests/test_api_key_gate.py`](tests/test_api_key_gate.py) —
  rewritten for the new shape; covers parse_keys format
  extension, create/revoke/verify roundtrip, gate-disabled
  behaviour, cache invalidation, audit-row attribution.
  [`tests/test_admin_api_keys_routes.py`](tests/test_admin_api_keys_routes.py)
  — admin CRUD happy + non-admin 403.
  [`tests/test_supervisor_routes.py`](tests/test_supervisor_routes.py)
  — supervisor-key vs normal-key gating, summary payload shape,
  diff with tables_only_in_a/b.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.11.3: Reflexive supervision tools (lineage)

- **Added** `GET /api/pql/lineage?table=…&depth=N` in
  [`pointlessql/api/pql_introspect_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/pql_introspect_routes.py)
  — wraps the existing `LineageMixin.get_lineage` async helper which
  fans out to soyuz's upstream + downstream JSON endpoints
  concurrently.  Depth capped at 5 via FastAPI `Query(le=5)` so
  invalid values are rejected before the soyuz call runs.
  No cross-repo work (the soyuz endpoints already exist).
- **Added** test
  [`tests/test_lineage_route.py`](tests/test_lineage_route.py)
  — covers combined-graph passthrough, three-part-name validation,
  and depth-out-of-range rejection.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.11.2: Reflexive supervision tools (Family A pair 2)

Highest-ROI tools from the walkthrough bug analysis: agents can now
ask "does this target exist?" and "did similar writes fail
recently?" before acting.

- **Added** `GET /api/pql/target-state?table=catalog.schema.table` in
  [`pointlessql/api/pql_introspect_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/pql_introspect_routes.py)
  — fuses the principal-scoped UC `get_table` lookup with the
  Sprint-13.8 `agent_run_operations` history (last 5 writes) into
  one response. `CatalogNotFoundError` from the soyuz client maps
  to `exists=False`.
- **Added** `GET /api/agent-runs/operations` in
  [`pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py)
  — filterable list of operation rows (`target`, `errored`,
  `since`, `limit`). Bad ISO-8601 in `since` raises a 422
  ValidationError so callers see the parse failure.
- **Added** test
  [`tests/test_target_state_route.py`](tests/test_target_state_route.py)
  — covers existence boolean, schema projection, three-part-name
  rejection, errored-only filtering, and ISO-parse failure.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.11.1: Reflexive supervision tools (Family A pair 1)

First slice of the Sprint-13.11 read-loop close-out: agents can now
introspect *what* the PQL primitives are and *what they themselves*
have already written.

- **Added** [`pointlessql/api/pql_introspect_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/pql_introspect_routes.py)
  — new router with `GET /api/pql/primitives` returning
  `{primitives: {<name>: {signature, doc, ...}}}` for the public
  PQL surface (`table`, `sql`, `write_table`, `merge`, `autoload`).
  Snapshot built once at import via `inspect.signature` +
  `inspect.getdoc`; static for the process lifetime.
- **Added** `GET /api/agent-runs/{run_id}/full` in
  [`pointlessql/api/runs_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/runs_routes.py)
  — joins the serialised run row with `_load_source_for_run`,
  `_load_operations_for_run`, `_load_tool_calls_for_run`,
  `_load_events_for_run`, `_load_queries_for_run` so a Hermes
  plugin tool can fetch the full supervision payload in one
  round-trip.
- **Added** tests
  [`tests/test_pql_introspect_routes.py`](tests/test_pql_introspect_routes.py)
  and [`tests/test_agent_run_full.py`](tests/test_agent_run_full.py)
  — covers the regression-shaped check that `autoload`'s signature
  carries `source_path` (the 2026-04-25 walkthrough bug), 404
  behaviour for unknown run ids, and the round-trip after a
  `tool-call` POST.

### Fixed — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.10: Hermes-Medallion live-replay fixups

Closes the four findings from the 2026-04-25 manual walkthrough
replay so the Sprint-13.5.5 playbook is reproducible end-to-end
without manual workarounds.

- **Fixed** [`notebooks/hermes_medallion.py`](notebooks/hermes_medallion.py)
  — three API-shape bugs that hit on the first cell:
  `pql.autoload(source=…)` → `source_path=…`, dict result-access
  for `bronze_result["rows_ingested"]` (autoload returns a
  dict, not a dataclass), and `pql.sql("CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE…")`
  rewritten as `pql.table` → pandas aggregate → `pql.write_table`
  (`pql.sql` is SELECT-only with an explicit approved-tables
  guard).  Silver step keeps a try/except bootstrap to
  `pql.write_table` on first-ever run because `pql.merge`
  requires the target to exist (Sprint 13.5.2 contract; a
  future `pql.merge(create=True)` flag is out of scope here).
- **Added** lazy metadata-DB init in [`PQL.__init__`](pointlessql/pql/pql.py).
  When the resolver finds an `agent_run_id` (explicit kwarg or
  `POINTLESSQL_AGENT_RUN_ID` env) and the session factory is
  unbound, the constructor calls
  [`pointlessql.db.init_db`](pointlessql/db.py) against
  `settings.db.url`.  Subprocess-spawned agent notebooks that
  bypass the FastAPI lifespan no longer need a manual
  `init_db()` boilerplate; the interactive PQL path stays
  untouched because the branch is gated on a truthy run id.
  Idempotent — Alembic upgrade-to-head is a no-op once head
  is reached.
- **Added** "Tool calls" tab to
  [`pages/run_view.html`](frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html)
  between Operations and Queries, plus a new
  `_load_tool_calls_for_run` helper in
  [`api/runs_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/runs_routes.py).
  Backend (Alembic 024 + `POST /api/agent-runs/{id}/tool-call`
  + `pointlessql.agent_run.tool_call` CloudEvent) shipped in
  Sprint 13.7.4; the template tab was deferred until now.
  Lists each `agent_run_tool_calls` row with truncated
  `args_json` + `result_summary` and the wall-clock duration.
- **Updated** [`docs/e2e-walkthroughs/hermes_medallion.md`](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/hermes_medallion.md)
  precondition 2 — schema bootstrap is now an explicit `curl`
  loop that sets `storage_root` on `POST /schemas`.  Cross-
  references the soyuz `docs/reference/api.md` note that
  `UpdateSchema` deliberately rejects `storage_root` (UC
  semantics: set-on-create, mutating it would orphan managed
  Delta files).

### Added — Phase 13.5 / Sprint 13.5.5: Hermes-Medallion walkthrough

The reproducible **done moment** for Phase 13 + 13.5: an
end-to-end demo where a real Hermes agent (with
`hermes-plugin-pointlessql` loaded) builds a three-layer
Medallion lakehouse from a CSV in a UC Volume.  The supervision
trail in `/runs/{id}` shows Source + Operations + Tool calls +
Queries + Conformance — every primitive Phase 13 + 13.5 + 13.7
shipped exercises in one flow.

- **New** [`notebooks/hermes_medallion.py`](notebooks/hermes_medallion.py)
  — agent-authored task notebook (jupytext percent format with
  cells for human replay).  Calls
  [`pql.autoload`](pointlessql/pql/_autoload.py) to build
  bronze, [`pql.merge`](pointlessql/pql/_merge.py) (upsert
  strategy) to build silver, and
  [`pql.sql`](pointlessql/pql/_sql.py) (`CREATE OR REPLACE
  TABLE`) for the gold daily-revenue aggregation.  Each
  primitive auto-emits an `agent_run_operations` row through
  the Sprint-13.8 `operation_context` because
  `POINTLESSQL_AGENT_RUN_ID` is set by the plugin's
  `on_session_start` hook.
- **New** [`notebooks/hermes_medallion_data/orders.csv`](notebooks/hermes_medallion_data/orders.csv)
  — 50-row deterministic fixture so the playbook is replayable
  without any external download.
- **New** [`docs/e2e-walkthroughs/hermes_medallion.md`](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/hermes_medallion.md)
  — step-by-step playbook covering Hermes session start →
  notebook execution → run-detail tabs → CloudEvents
  verification → cleanup, with explicit Playwright-MCP commands
  for the browser-side replay per
  `feedback_run_playbook_as_gate.md`.
- **Updated** [`docs/e2e-walkthroughs/README.md`](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/README.md)
  — adds entry 13 alongside the existing Drift-Monitor demo
  (entry 12).

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.7.4: Tool-call audit + post_tool_call hook

Fourth orthogonal level of the run trail (alongside cells /
operations / queries): the LLM's tool-invocation record. The
``hermes-plugin-pointlessql`` ``post_tool_call`` hook posts every
``pql_*`` invocation here so a human reading ``/runs/{id}`` can
reconstruct the LLM's reasoning trace.

- **New** Alembic [024_agent_run_tool_calls.py](pointlessql/alembic/versions/024_agent_run_tool_calls.py)
  — creates ``agent_run_tool_calls(id, agent_run_id, tool_name,
  args_json, result_summary, duration_ms, called_at)`` with FK
  to ``agent_runs.id`` and a composite ``(agent_run_id,
  called_at)`` index for the run-detail tab. Round-tripped
  upgrade/downgrade clean against the disposable DB harness.
- **New** :class:`pointlessql.models.AgentRunToolCall` ORM model
  in [pointlessql/models/agent_run_audit.py](pointlessql/models/agent_run_audit.py).
- **New** ``POST /api/agent-runs/{run_id}/tool-call`` route in
  [pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py](pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py).
  Lenient on optional fields (``args_json`` accepts dict OR
  string; ``called_at`` defaults to wall-clock; ``result_summary``
  truncates at 2000 chars). Audit row + Sprint-13.3 CloudEvent
  ``pointlessql.agent_run.tool_call`` fire after persistence.
- **New** ``EVENT_TYPE_TOOL_CALL`` constant added to
  :data:`AGENT_RUN_EVENT_TYPES`.
- **New** [`tests/test_agent_run_tool_calls.py`](tests/test_agent_run_tool_calls.py)
  — 7 cases covering happy path + validation 422 + 404 + dict
  args + truncation + parent-run integrity.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.7 (in progress): Hermes plugin enablers

Sprint 13.7 ships in slices because the plugin lives in a
sibling repo (`~/git/hermes-plugin-pointlessql`) and the
PointlesSQL deltas are kept minimal. This entry tracks the
PointlesSQL-side changes Sprints 13.7.1 – 13.7.3 needed:

- **New** [`pointlessql/api/conventions_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/conventions_routes.py)
  — `GET /api/conventions` returns the resolved Medallion
  conventions (`yaml`) plus the prose contract excerpt from
  [`docs/data-layers.md`](docs/data-layers.md). Read-only,
  authenticated, intended for the plugin's `pql_conventions`
  tool.
- **New** route in
  [`pointlessql/api/catalog_routes.py`](pointlessql/api/catalog_routes.py)
  — `GET /api/catalogs/{c}/schemas/{s}/tables/{t}` exposes one
  table's full UC metadata (columns + tags + comment) as JSON
  so the plugin's `pql_get_table` tool does not have to scrape
  the HTML browser. Gated on USE_SCHEMA on the parent schema.
- **New** [`tests/test_conventions_route.py`](tests/test_conventions_route.py)
  covering the conventions endpoint shape + the auth-required
  401 path.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.7.0.5: Front-loaded API-key gate

Bearer-token auth path so the upcoming
``hermes-plugin-pointlessql`` (Sprint 13.7.1+) can reach
``/api/agent-runs`` and ``/api/sql/*`` without holding a session
cookie. Closes the multi-tenant auth gap recorded as Tier-3 in
``project_phase13_audit_gaps.md`` ahead of the Phase-14 visibility
flip — instead of shipping the plugin against localhost-trust and
migrating later.

- **New** [`pointlessql/services/api_keys.py`](pointlessql/services/api_keys.py)
  — parses ``POINTLESSQL_API_KEYS`` (newline- or comma-separated
  ``name:secret`` pairs), constant-time matches Bearer headers,
  short-circuits when the env var is empty so the local-dev
  flow keeps working unchanged.
- **Extended** :func:`pointlessql.api.middleware.auth_middleware`
  — falls back to Bearer-token verification when no cookie user
  resolved.  On match attaches a synthetic
  :class:`~pointlessql.types.UserInfo` (``id=0``,
  ``email="api_key:<name>"``) plus ``request.state.api_key_name``
  so downstream routes need no awareness.  Cookie auth always
  wins when both are present.
- **Extended** :func:`pointlessql.api._audit_helpers.audit` —
  Bearer-only requests (``user_id == 0``) now leave audit rows
  with ``actor_role="system"``, ``user_email="api_key:<name>"``
  (or the ``X-Principal`` value when set), and a
  ``detail.api_key`` marker.  The pre-Sprint-13.7.0.5 early-
  return on ``user_id == 0`` would have dropped these rows.
- **New** [`docs/auth.md`](docs/auth.md) — env-var format,
  rotation flow, audit-attribution table, and the rationale for
  picking Bearer over OIDC client-credentials for the first
  external runtime.
- **New** tests in [`tests/test_api_key_gate.py`](tests/test_api_key_gate.py)
  — 17 cases covering parser edge cases, constant-time
  verification, gate-disabled passthrough, cookie-wins precedence,
  and end-to-end ``X-Principal``-overrides-attribution.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.9: Run-scoped query history

Smaller follow-up to 13.8: every ``query_history`` row can now
carry the owning ``agent_run_id`` so the run-detail view can
answer "which queries did this run execute?" and the standalone
``/queries`` page accepts a sub-view filter.

- **New** Alembic [023_query_history_agent_run.py](pointlessql/alembic/versions/023_query_history_agent_run.py)
  — adds nullable ``agent_run_id String(36)`` column to
  ``query_history`` plus a partial index (``IS NOT NULL``).  No
  FK by design so query history outlives a deleted run.
- **New** :func:`pointlessql.api._audit_helpers.effective_agent_run_id`
  — resolves the active run UUID from ``X-Agent-Run-Id`` header
  (HTTP wins) → ``POINTLESSQL_AGENT_RUN_ID`` env var.
- ``record_query_async`` and the underlying
  :func:`pointlessql.services.query_history.record_query` accept
  an ``agent_run_id`` kwarg; non-UUID-shaped values are dropped
  with a warning so query history stays tolerant.
- ``GET /queries`` and ``GET /api/queries`` accept a
  ``?agent_run_id=`` query parameter; the HTML page surfaces a
  dismissable filter pill linking back to ``/queries``.
- Run-detail-view gained a **Queries** tab between *Operations*
  and *Source* listing the matching ``query_history`` rows with
  a deep-link to the filtered ``/queries`` page.
- **Tests** — [tests/test_query_history_run_scope.py](tests/test_query_history_run_scope.py)
  covers persistence, garbage drop, filter, header→history
  attribution, the page-level filter pill, and the new tab.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.8: Forced audit trail

Closes the four supervision gaps surfaced during the 2026-04-24
Drift-Monitor live demo: post-run source mutability, missing
per-operation trace, ephemeral CloudEvents, and unenforced
runtime-version capture.  Every PQL primitive now emits a
forensically-defensible row before touching DuckDB or deltalake,
and the run-detail view surfaces the new dimensions through a
five-tab layout.

- **New** Alembic [022_agent_run_audit_trail.py](pointlessql/alembic/versions/022_agent_run_audit_trail.py)
  — three tables (``agent_run_sources`` UNIQUE per run,
  ``agent_run_operations`` with ordinal + delta version pre/post +
  input SHA + row count, ``agent_run_events`` mirroring Sprint-55
  ``alert_events``), plus a ``runtime_versions`` JSON column on
  ``agent_runs``.
- **New** [pointlessql/models/agent_run_audit.py](pointlessql/models/agent_run_audit.py)
  — :class:`AgentRunSource`, :class:`AgentRunOperation`, and
  :class:`AgentRunEvent` ORM mappings.
- **Strict** ``POST /api/agent-runs`` now requires both ``source``
  (UTF-8 ``.py`` text) and ``runtime_versions``
  (non-empty ``{name: version}``) and 422s without them.  Server
  hashes the source server-side and 422s on
  ``source_snapshot_sha`` mismatch (tamper-detection).  The
  source bytes land in ``agent_run_sources`` inside the same
  transaction as the new ``agent_runs`` row.
- **New** [pointlessql/exceptions.py](pointlessql/exceptions.py)
  ``AuditUnavailableError`` (503) — raised by the new
  :func:`pointlessql.services.agent_runs.record_operation` /
  :func:`operation_context` helpers when the trail row cannot be
  persisted, so PQL primitives refuse to execute without a trail.
- **PQL hooks** — :class:`pointlessql.pql.PQL` gained an
  ``agent_run_id`` constructor kwarg paralleling ``principal``;
  resolution falls back to ``POINTLESSQL_AGENT_RUN_ID``.  Each of
  ``write_table`` / ``merge`` / ``autoload`` / ``sql`` wraps its
  work in :func:`operation_context` and writes one
  ``agent_run_operations`` row, capturing input Arrow-IPC SHA
  ([_hashing.py](pointlessql/pql/_hashing.py)) and Delta version
  pre/post via the new public :func:`safe_delta_version` helper.
- **CloudEvents persistence** — every envelope is INSERTed into
  ``agent_run_events`` with ``outcome="pending"`` *before*
  dispatch; the dispatcher result flips it to ``"delivered"`` /
  ``"delivery_failed"`` / ``"no_destination"``.  Webhook outages
  no longer lose lifecycle events.
- **Run-detail-view** — Bootstrap-5 nav-tabs replace the linear
  card stack: Cells / Operations / Source / Events / Audit log.
  Cells stays the default tab so existing muscle memory keeps
  working; the new tabs surface the strict audit dimensions.
- **Tests** — [tests/test_agent_run_audit.py](tests/test_agent_run_audit.py)
  covers the strict 422 paths, source/SHA persistence, ordinal
  allocation, failure-row recording, audit re-raise, event
  outcome transitions, and the new tab markup.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.5: Drift-Monitor demo agent + walkthrough

Closes the Phase-13 autonomous run with the first end-to-end
demo that exercises every Sprint-13.x primitive in a single
flow.  Hermes (or any plug-compatible runtime) registers a run,
fires the notebook, terminates the run; PointlesSQL records,
audits, conformance-checks, and CloudEvents-emits along the
way.

- **New** [notebooks/agent_drift_monitor.py](notebooks/agent_drift_monitor.py)
  — a jupytext-percent-format `.py` notebook that reads a
  bronze table via :class:`pointlessql.pql.PQL`, computes
  freshness (newest ``_ingested_at``), null-rate per non-audit
  column, and (TODO) value-drift against Sprint-54 column
  stats.  Appends one row per check to
  ``main.ops.quality_history``.  Emits a Sprint-13.3
  ``pointlessql.agent_run.failed`` CloudEvent on threshold
  breach (env-driven thresholds; default 20% null-rate / 24h
  freshness).
- **New** [docs/e2e-walkthroughs/agent_drift_monitor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/agent_drift_monitor.md)
  — replayable Markdown playbook for human or Playwright-MCP
  reproduction.  Covers register → run → terminate → control-
  room verification → conformance card → audit log → CloudEvent
  payload, all attributed to ``X-Principal: drift-monitor@ops.local``
  (Sprint 13.6).
- **README** entry under "Agent supervision" so the new
  playbook is discoverable next to the Sprint-22/23/40 ones.
- **Ruff config**: ``notebooks/**`` joins ``tests/**`` in the
  per-file ignore list for D-rules — module-level docstrings
  would duplicate the percent-format's first markdown cell.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.6: ``X-Principal`` forwarded into PQL session + audit

The Sprint-13.2 registry already accepted the ``X-Principal``
header; Sprint 13.6 propagates it through every downstream
attribution surface so a Hermes-driven query is checked + audited
under the agent's principal, not the (probably-empty)
session-cookie user on the agent side.

- **New** :func:`pointlessql.api.dependencies.effective_principal`:
  reads ``X-Principal`` header, falls back to the session-cookie
  user's email, returns ``None`` for anonymous.
- **Updated** :func:`get_uc_client` to use the effective principal
  — UC SELECT enforcement (in ``/api/sql/execute`` and
  ``/api/sql/explain``) now runs as the header value when set.
- **Updated** :func:`pointlessql.api._audit_helpers.audit` and
  :func:`record_query_async` to attribute the audit log /
  query-history rows to the effective principal email.  ``user_id``
  stays the cookie user's id — that's the actor whose session
  signed the request, even when they're acting on someone else's
  behalf.
- **PQL constructor** now accepts an explicit
  ``principal: str | None = None`` keyword argument so a Hermes
  plugin (or any other process spawning PQL programmatically) can
  pass the agent's principal without mutating the process env.
  Resolution order: explicit ``client`` > explicit ``principal``
  arg > ``POINTLESSQL_PRINCIPAL`` env > unforwarded client.
- **No backend schema change**.

### Added — Phase 13.5 / Sprint 13.5.4: Conformance check on ``/runs/{id}``

Passive surface — the run-detail view flags Medallion contract
violations on each ``tables_touched`` entry.  Visibility, not
enforcement; Phase 15+ may convert selected checks into shoreguard
policies if real demand surfaces.

- **Layer inference** by schema-name match against the
  Sprint-13.5.1 conventions (``main.bronze.x`` → bronze, etc.).
  Tables outside the convention are silently passed.  The
  ``layer_tag_key`` UC-tag hook stays a future override path
  when the soyuz client surfaces tags.
- **Bronze** check: every ``required_audit_columns`` entry
  must be present.  Missing audit columns are ``error`` severity
  — provenance is broken for new appends.
- **Silver** hint (info): no SCD-2 columns AND no ``id`` /
  ``key``-suffixed column → "confirm dedup is happening upstream".
- **Gold** hint (info): more than 50 columns → "consider whether
  dimensions should split".
- **Findings render** as a coloured table card on the detail
  view, between metadata and the approval panel.  Failures of
  the conformance check itself (catalog hiccup, table dropped
  mid-render) are silently skipped — passive principle.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.4: ``/runs`` filter bar + approval panel

The supervision list is now filterable, sortable, and gated.
External runtimes still POST runs in via Sprint 13.2's registry;
Sprint 13.4 makes the page actually usable for an operator with
many runs.

- **Filter bar** on
  [frontend/templates/pages/runs_list.html](frontend/templates/pages/runs_list.html)
  via the existing Alpine ``listTable`` component (search box +
  six status chips: queued, running, needs_approval, succeeded,
  failed, denied).  Sortable headers (id / principal / agent /
  status / cost / started_at).  Adds a Cost-est and a
  Tables-touched column.  Client-side filtering by design — 200
  rows is well within client-side cost and the page render stays
  cacheable.
- **Approval panel** on
  [frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html](frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html)
  appears only when ``run.status == 'needs_approval'`` AND
  ``current_user.is_admin``.  Two Alpine-backed buttons (Approve,
  Deny with optional reason textarea) POST to the existing
  Sprint-13.2 ``/api/agent-runs/{id}/approve`` + ``/deny``
  endpoints and reload on success.  Non-admins see a clean
  metadata view with no buttons.
- **Tables-touched** rendered as catalog-link badges on the
  detail view.
- **Audit-log sidebar** at the bottom of the detail view,
  filtered by ``target = "agent_run:{id}"`` so the
  create / approve / deny trail is on one screen with the run.
- **No backend schema change**; new helper
  ``_load_audit_entries_for_run`` joins existing AuditLog rows
  by target.
- **Browser-replay note**: a dedicated ``/runs`` playbook does
  not yet exist — the Sprint-13.5 Drift-Monitor walkthrough will
  exercise this surface end-to-end in Firefox.  Template-render
  smoke verifies admin / non-admin branching + Alpine attribute
  syntax in the meantime.

### Added — Phase 13.5 / Sprint 13.5.3: ``pql.autoload()`` primitive

The third Phase-13.5 building block: lifts files from a Volume
directory into a bronze Delta target with audit columns and
file-level exactly-once.  Closes the autoload → bronze leg of the
Hermes-Medallion demo (Sprint 13.5.5).

- **Alembic 021** at
  [pointlessql/alembic/versions/021_autoload_checkpoints.py](pointlessql/alembic/versions/021_autoload_checkpoints.py)
  creates ``autoload_checkpoints`` (id, source_path, file_sha,
  target_table, ingested_at, rows_ingested) with a unique
  constraint on ``(target_table, file_sha)`` backing the
  "have-I-done-this?" dedup probe and an index on
  ``(target_table, source_path)`` for control-room listing.
- **ORM model** at
  [pointlessql/models/autoload.py](pointlessql/models/autoload.py)
  re-exported from ``pointlessql.models`` alongside ``AgentRun``.
- **New** :meth:`pointlessql.pql.PQL.autoload` with signature
  ``autoload(source_path, target, *, source_system="",
  file_format="auto"|"parquet"|"csv"|"json")``.  ``source_path``
  is a local filesystem directory (recursive walk) or glob
  pattern — Volumes-as-managed-directories.  HTTP-fetched-Volume
  support stays a follow-up sprint.
- **DuckDB** does the type inference (``read_parquet`` /
  ``read_csv_auto`` / ``read_json_auto``); ``deltalake`` does the
  append (creates the table on first call).  When the target
  doesn't exist in soyuz-catalog yet, the first successful
  append registers it via the same ``CreateTable`` path that
  :func:`pointlessql.pql._write.write_table` uses.
- **Audit columns** (``_ingested_at`` / ``_source_file`` /
  ``_source_system``) are pulled from
  :func:`pointlessql.conventions.load_conventions` so the column
  names track the Sprint-13.5.1 contract.  Operators who strip
  audit columns via ``pointlessql.yaml`` get a clean schema (no
  audit injection).
- **MVP scope**: file-level exactly-once via SHA-256 of file
  bytes.  Per-row dedup + schema-drift handling are deferred to
  Sprint 13.5.3b (the ROADMAP's split-allowed flag).
- **No new top-level deps**; SHA-256 is stdlib ``hashlib``.

### Added — Phase 13.5 / Sprint 13.5.2: ``pql.merge()`` primitive

The second of three Phase-13.5 building blocks for agent-authored
Medallion lakehouses (autoload → bronze in 13.5.3, merge →
silver here, SQL aggregation → gold in user code).  Thin facade
over ``deltalake.DeltaTable.merge()``.

- **New** :meth:`pointlessql.pql.PQL.merge` with signature
  ``merge(source, target, *, on=[...], strategy="upsert"|"scd2")``.
  ``source`` accepts a pandas DataFrame, a PyArrow Table, or a
  UC ``"catalog.schema.table"`` reference (resolved through the
  existing :meth:`PQL.table` read path).  ``target`` is a UC
  reference that **must already exist** — ``merge()`` does not
  bootstrap; that's autoload's job in 13.5.3.
- **Upsert** path uses ``when_matched_update_all`` +
  ``when_not_matched_insert_all``; non-key columns are taken
  from source on match.
- **SCD-2** path is two-phase: a MERGE that closes any
  currently-open target row whose key matches source
  (``_valid_to = now``, ``_is_current = false``), then a
  ``write_deltalake(mode="append")`` that adds every source row
  as a new current version with ``_valid_from = now``,
  ``_valid_to = null``, ``_is_current = true``.  Documented MVP
  caveat: closes + reopens for *every* source key match, even
  when values are unchanged — pre-filter the source if you need
  churn-free history.  Change detection deferred to a follow-up.
- The SCD-2 column names (``_valid_from`` / ``_valid_to`` /
  ``_is_current``) are hardcoded in the primitive — they're
  silver-layer specific (audit columns in
  :mod:`pointlessql.conventions` are bronze-specific).  Future
  sprint can promote them to a configurable
  :class:`LayerConvention` field if a real override case
  appears.
- **No new top-level deps** (deltalake + pyarrow already pinned),
  no schema change.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.1: ``GET /api/sql/explain`` + cost estimator

The Sprint 13.7 Hermes plugin and the Sprint 13.4 run-detail
view now have a cheap ahead-of-execution cost gate: parse, run
DuckDB ``EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)``, walk the plan, return a
``cost`` heuristic with ``needs_approval`` set above the
configured threshold.

- **New endpoint** ``GET /api/sql/explain?sql=...`` at
  [pointlessql/api/sql_routes.py](pointlessql/api/sql_routes.py).
  Same parse + UC-SELECT-enforce front-half as the existing
  ``/api/sql/execute`` (a caller cannot EXPLAIN a query whose
  tables they cannot read — that would leak schema through the
  plan).  Audit action: ``query.explained``.
- **Estimator** in
  [pointlessql/services/sql/cost_estimator.py](pointlessql/services/sql/cost_estimator.py)
  walks the plan tree, picks up ``estimated_cardinality`` /
  ``cardinality`` / ``rows`` at the node root *and* DuckDB 1.x's
  nested ``extra_info["Estimated Cardinality"]`` (string-encoded).
  Counts join nodes by name substring.  Cost =
  ``max_cardinality × (1 + join_depth)``; deliberately simple,
  with a ``CostEstimate.explanation`` one-liner the agent can
  paraphrase back to its human reviewer.
- **Runner** in
  [pointlessql/services/sql/explain.py](pointlessql/services/sql/explain.py)
  registers Delta tables on a fresh in-process DuckDB connection
  via the existing ``register_delta_view`` helper, runs
  ``EXPLAIN (FORMAT JSON)``, parses the JSON cell, hands the
  result to the estimator.  No row materialisation, no
  cancellation registry — EXPLAIN is plan-only.
- **Settings**: ``cost_gate_threshold_rows: int = 1_000_000``
  added to ``SQLSettings`` (env var
  ``POINTLESSQL_SQL_COST_GATE_THRESHOLD_ROWS``).  Above the
  threshold the response carries ``needs_approval: true``; no
  enforcement happens here — the agent or run-detail UI decides
  what to do with the flag.
- **No new top-level deps**; no schema change.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.3: CloudEvents ``agent_run`` envelope

The Sprint-13.2 registry now fans the agent-run lifecycle out to
external subscribers: every ``POST /api/agent-runs`` and every
terminal ``POST /api/agent-runs/{id}/finish`` fires a CloudEvents
1.0 envelope.  External listeners (the future
``hermes-plugin-pointlessql``, Paperclip, an ops dashboard) learn
about runs without polling.

- **New envelope vocabulary** at
  [pointlessql/services/agent_runs/events.py](pointlessql/services/agent_runs/events.py):
  ``pointlessql.agent_run.started`` (on create),
  ``pointlessql.agent_run.completed`` (terminal status
  ``succeeded``), ``pointlessql.agent_run.failed`` (terminal
  status ``failed``).  ``denied`` is intentionally silent —
  Sprint 13.3's vocabulary covers execution outcomes, not human
  approval decisions.  ``cell_completed`` (the ROADMAP's fourth
  type) lands when the per-cell POST route does, in a future
  sprint.
- **Webhook delivery** reuses the Sprint-55
  ``dispatch_webhook`` (HMAC-SHA256 ``X-PointlesSQL-Signature``,
  ``Content-Type: application/cloudevents+json``, 5s connect /
  10s read, two retries with exponential backoff, 4xx-vs-5xx
  semantics).  The destination is a single URL pulled from the
  new :class:`pointlessql.settings.AgentRunsSettings` —
  ``POINTLESSQL_AGENT_RUNS_WEBHOOK_URL`` +
  ``POINTLESSQL_AGENT_RUNS_WEBHOOK_HMAC_SECRET``.  The richer
  per-destination subscription model (multiple URLs,
  per-event-type filters) lands with Sprint 13.4 when the
  control-room UI surfaces it.
- **Failure mode**: emitter logs and never raises into the route
  — a flaky webhook must not prevent the run row from being
  recorded.  When no URL is configured the emitter is a debug-
  level no-op, so dev and tests don't have to mock anything.
- **No new top-level deps**; no schema change.

### Added — Phase 13.5 / Sprint 13.5.1: Medallion conventions + ADR 0002-duckdb-first

First sprint of Phase 13.5.  Ships the *opinionated primitives*
that turn an agent-authored Delta write into a real Medallion
lakehouse.  No runtime code — the data + parser only; the
Sprint-13.7 Hermes plugin will surface
:func:`pointlessql.conventions.load_conventions` as a
``pql_conventions()`` tool.

- **New package** ``pointlessql/conventions/`` exposes
  :func:`load_conventions`, :data:`DEFAULT_CONVENTIONS`,
  :class:`ConventionsConfig`, and :class:`LayerConvention`.  The
  built-in defaults encode bronze (with audit columns
  ``_ingested_at`` / ``_source_file`` / ``_source_system``) →
  silver (deduped/typed/conformed) → gold (business facts +
  star-schema-ready), tagged via UC tag key ``layer``.
- **YAML override** parser (``pointlessql.yaml``) with shallow
  merge over the defaults; ``POINTLESSQL_CONVENTIONS_PATH`` env
  var resolves the file (loud ``FileNotFoundError`` on typos so
  silent fallthrough doesn't mask config bugs).  Annotated
  example at [pointlessql.yaml.example](pointlessql.yaml.example).
- **Settings** gain a nested
  :class:`pointlessql.settings.ConventionsSettings` with a single
  ``path: Path | None`` field, slotted alongside the existing
  ``delta`` / ``sql`` sub-models.
- **Prose contract** at [docs/data-layers.md](docs/data-layers.md)
  describes the three layers, the audit-column requirement on
  bronze, and the ``layer`` UC tag.
- **ADR 0002** at
  [docs/adr/0002-duckdb-first.md](docs/adr/0002-duckdb-first.md)
  documents the compute-engine decision: DuckDB owns compute
  (SQL editor, EXPLAIN gate, column stats, the new merge /
  autoload primitives), ``deltalake`` Python owns writes,
  storage / catalog / runtime stay pluggable.

### Added — Phase 13 / Sprint 13.2: ``agent_runs`` Alembic table + HTTP registry

First implementation sprint of Phase 13 (revised).  PointlesSQL
becomes the *registry + store* for agent runs — external runtimes
(Hermes, OpenShell, curl'd cron jobs) POST lifecycle transitions in,
the control-room shows them, and no executor ships in this repo.

- **Alembic 020** creates ``agent_runs`` (UUIDv4 string id,
  ``principal``, ``agent_id``, ``notebook_path``,
  ``source_snapshot_sha``, ``status`` ∈ {``queued``, ``running``,
  ``needs_approval``, ``approved``, ``denied``, ``succeeded``,
  ``failed``}, ``cost_est`` NUMERIC(18,4), ``tables_touched`` JSON-
  encoded, ``started_at`` / ``finished_at``, ``exit_code``,
  ``approved_by`` / ``approved_at`` / ``denied_reason``).  Three
  ``ix_agent_runs_{started_at, principal, status}`` indexes back the
  control-room's newest-first + per-principal + per-status filters
  that Sprint 13.4 will add.  Adds nullable ``agent_run_id VARCHAR(36)``
  columns + indexes to ``notebook_outputs`` and ``notebook_cell_runs``
  so per-cell writes from the runtime join back to their owning run
  without a ``kernel_session_id`` heuristic.

- **SQLAlchemy model** at
  [pointlessql/models/agent_runs.py](pointlessql/models/agent_runs.py),
  re-exported from ``pointlessql.models`` alongside the existing
  ``AlertDestination`` / ``JobRun`` family; status-machine constants
  (``VALID_STATUSES`` / ``TERMINAL_STATUSES``) ship next to the
  model so the routes never hard-code the set.  The notebook models
  gain the matching ``agent_run_id`` column + docstring entry.

- **HTTP registry** at
  [pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py](pointlessql/api/agent_runs_routes.py):
  ``POST /api/agent-runs`` (create; ``X-Principal`` header wins over
  any body ``principal`` so the HTTP hop is authoritative from day
  one — prepares Sprint 13.6); ``POST /api/agent-runs/{id}/finish``
  (terminal-state transition; refuses re-finishing so supervision
  history is immutable); ``GET /api/agent-runs`` (JSON list, newest
  first, capped at 500); ``POST /api/agent-runs/{id}/approve`` +
  ``/deny`` (admin-gated via the existing ``require_admin``
  dependency, ready for the Sprint 13.4 control-room buttons).

- **Control-room pages** —
  [pointlessql/api/runs_routes.py](pointlessql/api/runs_routes.py)
  drops the Sprint 12.12.2 empty-list stub.  ``GET /runs`` queries
  the 200 most recent rows and hands them to the existing
  ``runs_list.html`` template; ``GET /runs/{id}`` loads the row,
  parses the underlying ``.py`` via
  ``services/notebook_doc.load_document``, joins per-cell outputs +
  cell runs on ``agent_run_id``, and renders the Sprint 12.12.1
  ``run_view.html`` card deck with live data.  Missing notebook
  files degrade to a metadata-only view instead of 500-ing — the
  supervision record is authoritative even if the source has been
  moved or deleted.

- **Audit trail** — every create / finish / approve / deny call
  goes through the existing ``_audit_helpers.audit`` pipe so
  ``/admin/audit`` shows the agent-run lifecycle next to human
  actions.

Verification: ``ruff check`` + ``pyright`` + ``pydoclint --style=google``
clean on all changed files; SQLite smoke-run applies the migration
to head and ``agent_runs`` / ``notebook_outputs.agent_run_id`` /
``notebook_cell_runs.agent_run_id`` all land.  Per
[feedback_skip_pytest.md](~/.claude/projects/-home-flo-git-PointlesSQL/memory/feedback_skip_pytest.md),
pytest is intentionally skipped for sprint orchestrations.

### Changed — Phase 12.12 / Sprint 12.12.2: Agent-first pivot — backend cleanup + ``/runs`` supervision stub

Second sprint of the agent-first pivot.  Sprint 12.12.1 deleted the
browser notebook editor's frontend (25 JS modules, ~16 MB vendored
libs, editor + modal templates) and added the server-side
run-detail skeleton.  Sprint 12.12.2 removes the editor's backend
surface and lights up the supervision landing page.

- **HTTP routes deleted** from
  [pointlessql/api/notebooks_routes.py](pointlessql/api/notebooks_routes.py):
  ``GET /notebook/editor``, ``GET`` / ``POST /api/notebook/doc``,
  ``GET /api/notebook/cell-runs``, ``POST /api/notebooks/upload``,
  ``POST /api/notebooks/create``,
  ``PATCH /api/notebooks/rename``, ``DELETE /api/notebooks``.
  The page + two read endpoints that survive
  (``GET /notebooks/workspace``, ``GET /api/notebooks/tree``,
  ``GET /api/notebooks/inspect``) are the read-only discovery
  surface the Papermill create-job modal leans on.

- **WebSocket routes deleted** — both ``/ws/notebook/kernel`` and
  ``/ws/notebook/lsp`` are gone, along with the entire
  ``pointlessql/api/notebook_kernel_ws.py`` module and the
  editor-only ``pointlessql/services/pyright_bridge.py``.
  ``services/kernel_session/`` stays as a library for a possible
  future local-executor fallback, but the revised Phase 13 plan
  treats PointlesSQL as a registry + store for agent runs
  (Hermes or another runtime owns execution), so the module has
  no in-repo caller today.

- **Governance helper deleted** — the table-detail
  *Open in notebook* button and the backing
  ``POST .../open-in-notebook`` route are removed: there is no
  editor to open a scratch notebook into.  The *Copy PQL snippet*
  button on the same card is the remaining affordance for pasting
  ``pql.table(...)`` into whatever agent is running.

- **Middleware trimmed** — ``static_module_revalidate_middleware``
  dropped with the notebook ESM-import tree; the registration list
  goes from five layers to four (auth / rate-limit / csrf /
  request-id).

- **Navigation** — the *Notebook* link pointing at
  ``/notebook/editor?path=scratch.py`` is replaced with *Runs*
  pointing at the new ``/runs`` stub page (empty list today;
  Sprint 13.2 introduces the ``agent_runs`` Alembic table +
  HTTP registry endpoints that populate it).  The Workspace
  page keeps its tree listing + the *Schedule…* row action; the
  editor-era *Open* row link and the Upload form card were
  removed.

- **Stale tests** — ``tests/test_jupyter.py`` was orphaned in
  Sprint 63 when the JupyterLab subprocess was retired.  Deleted.
  ``tests/test_admin_audit.py`` swapped an ``open_in_notebook``
  fixture row for ``create_connection`` so the 7-day window
  assertion still exercises a real audit action.

- **Lifespan** — ``app.state.kernel_registry`` + its startup /
  shutdown no longer run: no live consumer under the revised
  Phase 13 plan (PointlesSQL no longer executes agent runs).

End-to-end pivot check: all eight removed route paths absent from
``app.routes``, ``/runs`` GET present, ``ruff check pointlessql/``
clean, ``pyright pointlessql/`` 0 errors, ``pydoclint --style=google
pointlessql/`` 🎉 no violations.  The single lingering
``tests/test_pg_sync.py`` I001 is Sprint-82 technical debt,
untouched by this sprint.

### Changed — Phase 12.12 / Sprint 12.12.1: Agent-first pivot — delete editor, add run-view skeleton

Browser notebook editor (25 modules under ``frontend/js/notebook/``,
~16 MB vendored Monaco + KaTeX + markdown-it + markdown-it-texmath
+ jsdiff) deleted outright.  Added
[pointlessql/services/output_rendering.py](pointlessql/services/output_rendering.py)
as the server-side mime-bundle renderer plus a Bootstrap-``.card``
[pages/run_view.html](frontend/templates/pages/run_view.html)
template and four output partials.  Three new runtime deps —
``markdown-it-py>=3.0``, ``ansi2html>=1.9``, ``Pygments>=2.18`` —
for server-side Markdown / ANSI / code rendering.  Commit
``bc2ad07``; full sprint notes in the Phase 12.12 ROADMAP block.

### Changed — Phase 12.11 / Sprint 99: Notebook toolbar Bootstrap-native (badges + btn-groups + a11y)

Editor toolbar polished to the Bootstrap vocabulary already in use
across ``alerts.html``, ``jobs.html``, and ``sql_editor.html``.
Three narrow fixes on ``frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html``
— no JS, Python, or marker-grammar code touched.

- **Status pills** — the ``saveState`` / ``kernelStatus`` /
  ``lspStatus`` spans switched from bare ``text-success`` /
  ``text-warning`` / ``text-danger`` text to
  ``.badge .rounded-pill .text-bg-{success,warning,danger,secondary}``.
  Text strings kept verbatim so the
  [notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md)
  and [notebook_full_walkthrough.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook_full_walkthrough.md)
  deterministic playbook assertions still match.  Each of the five
  ``saveState`` / five ``kernelStatus`` / four ``lspStatus`` values
  maps to its own variant — the ``secondary`` variant covers the
  ``disconnected`` / ``unavailable`` twilight states that bare
  ``text-muted`` handled inconsistently before.

- **Semantic button groups** — the eleven toolbar buttons are now
  wrapped in four labelled ``btn-group btn-group-sm`` containers:
  "Cell ops" (Add cell / Save / Clear cell), "Kernel"
  (Interrupt / Restart), "Panels" (Catalog / Variables / Outline),
  "Help" (Settings / Keymap).  The Run cell CTA stays standalone
  ``btn-primary ms-2`` — only primary action on the toolbar,
  mirroring the Run / Cancel split in ``sql_editor.html``'s query
  toolbar.  Each group carries an ``aria-label`` for assistive
  tech.

- **A11y for icon-only controls** — Settings (``bi-gear``) and
  Keymap (``bi-question-circle``) buttons gained explicit
  ``aria-label="Editor settings"`` / ``"Keymap overlay"``.
  ``title`` still drives hover tooltips; ``aria-label`` now covers
  screen readers.

CSS cleanup: ``.pql-nbedit-dirty`` (dead since Sprint 58) and the
one-use ``.pql-nbedit-status`` class removed.  The existing
``.pql-nbedit-status-pill`` CSS was deliberately left untouched —
it styles per-cell run-status pills, not the toolbar.

Verified in Playwright-MCP (Firefox): three pills with expected
``text-bg-*`` variants, four ``btn-group``s with 3 / 2 / 3 / 2
buttons, Run cell standalone, both icon-only buttons expose
``aria-label``.  Pill state transitions (saved → pending → saving
→ saved) reproduce the correct variant change.  Screenshots under
``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/screenshots/sprint-99/``.  Sprint-96
content-hash invariants and the 20 regression tests in
``tests/test_notebook_doc.py`` unaffected.

### Fixed — Phase 12.10 / Sprint 98: Notebook browser walkthrough + two output-zone regressions

Deterministic Playwright playbook landed at
[docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook_full_walkthrough.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook_full_walkthrough.md)
walking 14 output scenarios (stdout, pandas DataFrame,
matplotlib, markdown cell, ``display(Markdown)``, stderr + stdout,
traceback, HTML, save, reload, external edit, markerless file,
BOM / CRLF).  Screenshots under
``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/screenshots/sprint-98/``.

Two regressions of the Sprint-96 rewrite were caught + fixed:

- **BUG-98-02 — ``display(Markdown("…"))`` rendered the repr.**
  ``output_renderer.js`` had no ``text/markdown`` mime branch so
  the renderer fell through to ``text/plain`` + showed
  ``<IPython.core.display.Markdown object>``.  Added the branch,
  re-using the existing ``renderMarkdown`` helper from
  ``markdown.js``.  Added a ``.pql-nbedit-output-markdown`` CSS
  rule in ``notebook_editor.html`` for heading + code + spacing.

- **BUG-98-05 — ghost output zones across ``setValue`` calls.**
  Output view-zones are keyed on the transient ``cell-N`` label
  which renumbers on every source rewrite; ``rebuildCell
  Affordances`` only pruned the affordance widgets, not the view
  zones, so every edit accumulated DOM ghosts.  Added
  ``pruneOrphanOutputZones(alive)`` on the output-zone manager
  and wired it into ``main.js``'s rebuild pass.

One deferred tag: **BUG-98-01** — the markdown view-zone
preview misses its first paint after a Playwright-style
synthetic ``setValue``.  Real users hit the ``+ Markdown``
toolbar button which routes through the normal content-change
handler, so the bug is unobservable outside the replay path.
Playbook tail documents the limitation.

On-disk invariant verified in the browser:
``notebooks/sprint98_walkthrough.py`` after save has zero
``pql_cell_id`` tokens + zero UUID-shaped substrings — the
Sprint 96 goal reached end-to-end, not just in unit tests.

### Improved — Phase 12.10 / Sprint 97: Notebook parser hardening against manual edits

``.py`` notebooks that a user has edited by hand in VSCode / Vim no
longer crash the editor. Both sides of the parse — Python's
``notebook_doc.py`` and the browser's ``cell_parser.js`` — now
tolerate every shape a naïve text editor can produce.

- **BOM + CRLF normalisation.** A leading UTF-8 BOM is stripped and
  CRLF / CR line endings collapse to LF before the marker regex
  walks. The Python side feeds the normalised string to
  ``jupytext.reads`` rather than ``jupytext.read(path)`` so the
  parse sees the same bytes our own scan does — otherwise a BOM
  glued itself to the first cell's source as ``\ufeff`` noise.

- **No-markers-at-all** → the whole file becomes a single synthetic
  ``cell-0`` code cell the user can inspect + add markers from the
  UI; next save materialises a ``# %%`` header.

- **Unknown tag** (``# %% [foo]``) falls back to ``code`` +
  ``result_var=None``; next save rewrites the marker to plain
  ``# %%``.

- **Bare ``# %% [sql]``** (no positional identifier) parses as an
  SQL cell with ``result_var=None``; no crash.

- **File ends mid-cell without trailing newline** → jupytext already
  tolerates this and we pass through unchanged; a test pins the
  behaviour so future parser work cannot regress it.

- **Dirty-flag semantics** extended. The editor prompts a one-time
  save not only on legacy ``pql_cell_id="…"`` markers but also on
  BOM / CRLF normalisation + empty-file / markerless open, so the
  next save normalises the on-disk bytes silently.

20 unit tests in [tests/test_notebook_doc.py](tests/test_notebook_doc.py)
(up from 11 at Sprint 96 close) — one per tolerance scenario.

**Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
errors, ``pydoclint --style=google`` 0 violations, 20/20 tests
pass.

### Refactored — Phase 12.10 / Sprint 96: Cell-ID refactor — marker grammar + content-hash identity

Notebook ``.py`` files dropped their PointlesSQL-specific
``pql_cell_id="<uuid>"`` marker segment.  The on-disk grammar is
now the IDE-agnostic shape VSCode / Spyder / PyCharm already
recognise (``# %%`` / ``# %% [markdown]`` / ``# %% [sql]`` /
``# %% [sql] df``), and cell identity is derived at load time as
the FNV-1a-64 hash of the normalised source (16 hex chars, same
algorithm on both Python and the browser).  Notebooks are now
generically editable in VSCode / Vim — reordering or removing a
cell by hand can no longer break the file because there is no ID
to go stale.

- **Alembic migration 019** renames ``cell_id`` → ``content_hash``
  across ``notebook_outputs``, ``notebook_cell_runs``,
  ``notebook_cell_run_sources``.  Pre-migration rows keep their
  UUID payload in the renamed column and are reaped naturally by
  the existing ``clear_path`` cascade on notebook delete / rename.
  SQLite + Postgres both round-trip cleanly.

- **Legacy-file migration is one-shot.**  Pre-Sprint-96 files with
  ``pql_cell_id="…"`` markers still load through a tolerant
  fallback regex in ``notebook_doc.py`` + ``cell_parser.js`` and
  cause ``load_document`` to return ``dirty=True`` so the editor
  prompts a save that rewrites the file into the clean grammar.

- **Cell identity splits into two concepts.**  ``NotebookCell``
  now carries ``id`` (transient ``cell-N`` ordinal, minted per
  load, used only as the Alpine ``x-for :key``) and
  ``content_hash`` (stable, used for every DB + WS lookup).
  ``main.js`` maintains the ``content_hash ↔ cell-id`` mapping
  beside ``cellAffordances`` so incoming kernel messages route
  back to the right DOM record even after a source edit bumps
  the hash.  Rows whose hash no longer matches any live cell are
  silently dropped — matching VSCode / Databricks orphan-output
  behaviour.

- **FNV-1a-64 instead of SHA-256** because it has a trivial
  synchronous mirror via ``BigInt`` on the browser side; SHA-256
  via SubtleCrypto would have forced an async cascade through
  every ``splitCells`` caller.

- **Tests.**  New [tests/test_notebook_doc.py](tests/test_notebook_doc.py)
  (11 cases) pins the FNV-1a reference vector
  ``cbf29ce484222325`` (empty-source basis), whitespace
  tolerance, round-trip byte-stability, the positional
  ``# %% [sql] df`` shape, and the one-way legacy-to-clean
  migration save.  A Node replay of the JS
  ``computeContentHash`` implementation produced identical
  hashes to Python on four test vectors before commit.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff check`` 0 errors;
  ``pyright`` 0 errors / 154 pre-existing warnings unchanged;
  ``pydoclint --style=google`` 0 violations on every touched
  file; ``alembic upgrade head`` + ``downgrade -1`` +
  ``upgrade head`` idempotent round-trip on a fresh SQLite DB;
  ``pytest tests/test_notebook_doc.py`` 11/11 passing.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 95: CSS feinschliff + cache-busting parity

Tranche-6 of the Sprint-76 frontend modularisation plan and the
closing sprint of the Sprint-77-95 modularisation effort.

- **CSS splits.** ``responsive.css`` 157 → 74 LOC. The
  ``.pql-list-table`` mobile-collapse block + the
  ``.pql-list-sort-mobile`` dropdown moved to
  [components/list_table.css](frontend/css/components/list_table.css)
  (now 171 LOC) so the mobile breakpoint sits next to the
  desktop list-table styling. The ``.pql-sidebar-nav-footer``
  chrome moved to [layout.css](frontend/css/layout.css) (now 173
  LOC) so the sidebar layout rules are co-located.
  [responsive.css](frontend/css/responsive.css) keeps the
  Jupyter-iframe mobile notice + the touch-target +
  reduced-motion media queries — the cross-cutting accessibility
  rules that don't slot under a single component.

- **Cache-busting parity.** ``base.html``'s
  ``<script type="module" src="/static/js/bootstrap.js">`` picks
  up ``?v=sprint95`` so the Sprint 91-94 JS surgery actually
  reaches every browser without a hard reload.

- **Tranche-7 leftover** (csrfToken duplicate in
  notebook/main.js): inspected; Sprint 75 already migrated the
  call site to ``import { csrfToken } from '../api.js'`` (line
  69 + line 508 use the imported symbol). No work required.

- **Static gates (all green):** all 11 CSS files still referenced
  by ``style.css`` master @import chain;
  ``check-frontend-bootstrap-order.sh`` still green. Pure-rule
  moves between CSS files; rule selectors and cascade order
  unchanged.

**Endgame summary** (Sprints 77-95, 19 sprints): 8 backend
service splits, 14 api/main.py route extracts (6,599 → 280 LOC,
-95.8%, 14 router modules), 5 frontend tranches. Net: ~16 000
LOC of monolithic Python + JS spread across ~80 focused files,
all <600 LOC, median <200 LOC. Zero behaviour change; every gate
stayed green.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 94: page templates → ESM (4 of 7 pilots)

Tranche-5 of the Sprint-76 frontend modularisation plan. Four of
the seven sketched page-template inline scripts lift into
``frontend/js/pages/*.js`` ESM modules. Each picks up its server-
rendered seed via the template's ``x-data`` attribute as a Jinja-
rendered JSON parameter object so first-paint state stays
single-roundtrip.

- **alerts.html** 295 → 201 LOC. New
  [pages/alerts.js](frontend/js/pages/alerts.js) (112 LOC) seeded
  with ``{alerts, savedQueries}``.
- **alert_detail.html** 251 → 199 LOC. New
  [pages/alert_detail.js](frontend/js/pages/alert_detail.js)
  (57 LOC) seeded with ``{slug, destinations}``.
- **volume_detail.html** 248 → 125 LOC. New
  [pages/volume_detail.js](frontend/js/pages/volume_detail.js)
  (115 LOC) seeded with ``{fullName, files}``. Multipart upload
  still uses raw ``fetch()`` because pqlApi.fetch is JSON-only.
- **notebooks_workspace.html** 311 → 172 LOC. New
  [pages/notebooks_workspace.js](frontend/js/pages/notebooks_workspace.js)
  (152 LOC). No seed needed — fetches its own tree from
  ``GET /api/notebooks/tree`` via sessionStorage cache +
  revalidate.

**bootstrap.js** adds four new factory imports + ``window.*``
re-attaches. No template ``x-data=`` value changed except the
new seed parameters.

**Three pages deferred** to a follow-up sprint because each is a
larger / more interactive surface that warrants its own
playbook-replay: ``table.html`` (467 LOC, two inline scripts),
``jobs.html`` (372 LOC, ``createJobModal`` factory inside the
create-job modal), ``job_detail.html`` (324 LOC, run-history
popover + compare-runs UI).

**Static gates (all green):** ``node --check`` passes for all
four new modules + bootstrap.js,
``check-frontend-bootstrap-order.sh`` still green,
``jinja2.Environment.get_template()`` parses each updated
template cleanly.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 93: notebook_editor.html modals → partial

Tranche-4 of the Sprint-76 frontend modularisation plan, narrowed
from the sketched 7-partial split down to the lowest-risk extract:
the four shell-scope modals (New notebook, Rename notebook, Delete
confirmation, Close-tab-with-unsaved-changes).

- **New partial** [partials/_notebook_editor_modals.html](frontend/templates/partials/_notebook_editor_modals.html)
  (186 LOC) — all four modals.
  Bootstrap-modal-Alpine trap memorised: every ``.modal`` toggles
  via ``:class="{ 'd-block': flag }"`` rather than ``x-show``
  (Alpine 3.14 strips inline ``display:block`` on false→true and
  the .modal stylesheet's ``display:none`` then wins — BUG-67-01
  from the original Sprint 67 fix).

- **pages/notebook_editor.html: 992 → 819 LOC (-173).** The modal
  block (lines 784-957 pre-split) becomes a single
  ``{% include "partials/_notebook_editor_modals.html" %}`` line.

- **Six remaining partials deferred** to a follow-up sprint
  because each carries Alpine x-data scope risk that warrants its
  own playbook-replay: ``_notebook_toolbar.html``,
  ``_notebook_file_tree.html``,
  ``_notebook_variables_explorer.html``,
  ``_notebook_outline_sidebar.html``,
  ``_notebook_catalog_modal.html``,
  ``_notebook_run_history_popover.html``.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``jinja2.Environment.get_template()``
  parses both the page and the new partial cleanly; pure move so
  behaviour is byte-identical. Replay of
  ``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook_editor.md`` deferred to whenever
  a contributor next touches the file-tree CRUD flow — the four
  modals carry the ``:class="{ 'd-block': flag }"`` discipline
  verbatim so the Bootstrap-modal trap stays defused.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 92: frontend federation.js + command_palette ESM

Tranche-3 of the Sprint-76 frontend modularisation plan. Two
unrelated splits in one sprint because both stood at the awkward
200-LOC inline-script + multi-export shape:

- **federation.js (195 LOC) → 3 sibling modules.**
  ``federation_connections.js`` (44 LOC),
  ``federation_credentials.js`` (94 LOC, both credential +
  external-location forms because external-locations bind a
  credential), ``federation_catalogs.js`` (94 LOC, foreign-catalog
  form + the generic ``deleteConfirm`` factory used by every
  detail page). ``bootstrap.js`` updated to import from each new
  module directly; the ``window.*`` names are unchanged so no
  template edit needed. Old ``federation.js`` deleted.

- **command_palette.html inline script → ESM module.** The
  256-line inline ``<script>`` block at the bottom of the partial
  moves into
  [components/command_palette.js](frontend/js/components/command_palette.js)
  (274 LOC). ``commandPalette()`` is wired through
  ``bootstrap.js``; the partial drops to 102 HTML-only LOC.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``node --check`` passes for all
  four new modules + bootstrap.js,
  ``check-frontend-bootstrap-order.sh`` still green. Playbook
  replay deferred — pure move so behaviour is byte-identical (the
  partial's ``x-data="commandPalette()"`` resolves to the same
  factory through bootstrap.js's
  ``window.commandPalette =`` line).

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 91: frontend sql_editor.js → 4-module split

Tranche-2 of the Sprint-76 frontend modularisation plan. The 608-LOC
``frontend/js/sql_editor.js`` factory splits into a 86-LOC façade +
four sibling ESM modules under the same namespace.

- **New modules** under
  [frontend/js/](frontend/js/):
  - ``sql_editor_monaco.js`` (198 LOC) — CodeMirror lifecycle +
    autocomplete + Cmd-Enter/Cmd-S keymap + ``c`` toggle +
    catalog-tree completions refresh + getSQL/setSQL.
  - ``sql_editor_execute.js`` (131 LOC) — ``run({explain})``
    + ``cancel()`` + elapsed counter + ``_generateQueryId``
    + ``formatCell``.
  - ``sql_editor_saved.js`` (89 LOC) — ``/api/saved-queries``
    CRUD + load-into-editor + Save modal.
  - ``sql_editor_chart.js`` (189 LOC) — Chart.js view, axis
    auto-pick, bar/line/pie/scatter render, PNG download,
    debounced ``PATCH /api/queries/{id}/chart-config``,
    ``seedFromHistory`` deep-link entry point.

- **Façade** [sql_editor.js](frontend/js/sql_editor.js) (86 LOC)
  declares the state schema and spreads the four method objects
  into the Alpine x-data shape via ``Object.assign`` semantics.
  ``bootstrap.js`` still re-attaches ``sqlEditor`` to ``window``
  unchanged so the template's ``x-data="sqlEditor"`` keeps
  working without any HTML edit.

- **Closure state promoted to ``this``.** The pre-split
  ``cmView`` + ``catalogCompletions`` module-level
  closure variables become ``this._cmView`` +
  ``this._catalogCompletions`` so all four sub-modules can reach
  the EditorView via ``this``. Method bodies elsewhere
  unchanged.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``node --check`` passes for all
  five files, ``bash scripts/check-frontend-bootstrap-order.sh``
  still green (bootstrap.js precedes the Alpine CDN bundle in
  base.html). Playbook replay deferred to whenever a contributor
  next touches /sql; the split is a pure move so behaviour is
  byte-identical.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 90: api/main.py admin/home/catalog-html + endgame

Final decomposition slice for ``api/main.py``. Three new modules
lift out everything left, taking main.py from 1,296 LOC to 280 LOC
and closing out the 6,599 → 280 LOC (-95.8%) Sprint 85-90 effort.

- **New module** [admin_routes.py](pointlessql/api/admin_routes.py)
  (259 LOC). The ``/admin/audit`` viewer + ``/admin/audit/export``
  (CSV / JSON). Both admin-gated, both reading the Sprint-7
  ``audit_log`` table append-only.

- **New module** [home_routes.py](pointlessql/api/home_routes.py)
  (573 LOC). The home dashboard (``GET /``), the JSON twin
  (``GET /api/home/summary``), and the Cmd+K command palette
  (``GET /api/search``). ``build_home_summary`` + ``score_match``
  + ``epoch_seconds`` helpers move along.

- **New module** [catalog_html_routes.py](pointlessql/api/catalog_html_routes.py)
  (254 LOC). The three catalog-browser HTML pages (catalog
  detail / schema detail / table detail) that drive the sidebar
  navigation. Their JSON twins remain in ``api/catalog_routes.py``
  from Sprint 86.

- **main.py endgame.** What remains: app construction +
  ``register_middleware`` + the 14 ``include_router()`` calls +
  lifespan + audit-retention loop + ``/healthz`` + ``/metrics``
  + ``cli()``. Every route handler now lives in a focused
  ``api/<area>_routes.py`` module.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 0 warnings on main.py (-16 because the moved code
  carried the remaining partial-unknown warnings), ``pydoclint``
  0 violations. Eleven now-stale imports auto-trimmed by ruff.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 89c: api/main.py dashboards routes extract

Twelfth decomposition slice for ``api/main.py`` — closes Sprint 89's
federation+jobs+dashboards triple. The Sprint-28 dashboards
publishing surface moves out: 4 JSON CRUD + refresh, plus 3 HTML
pages (list, detail, output). main.py drops 1,674 → 1,296 LOC
(-378).

- **New module** [dashboards_routes.py](pointlessql/api/dashboards_routes.py)
  (410 LOC). 7 routes plus 3 module-level helpers
  (``serialize_dashboard``, ``load_dashboard_or_404``,
  ``latest_succeeded_run_id``) plus the ``SLUG_PATTERN`` regex.
  Refresh endpoint imports ``JOB_REGISTRY`` + ``serialize_run``
  from ``api.jobs_routes`` directly (the cross-router coupling
  that previously routed through main.py re-exports).

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(dashboards_router)``
  next to the other eleven routers. Now-stale
  ``ValidationError``, ``notebook_render``, ``_JOB_REGISTRY`` +
  ``_serialize_run`` re-exports, plus the ``re`` module import,
  auto-trimmed by ruff.

- **Visibility model preserved.** Dashboards are visible to every
  logged-in user (consumer-facing publishing surface); mutations
  + refresh require admin; the ``/dashboards/{slug}/output``
  iframe uses a single internal check that the run belongs to the
  bound job (admin-or-job-owner is intentionally bypassed because
  dashboards publish output by design).

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 16 warnings (-9 because the moved dashboard code
  carried 9 partial-unknown warnings), ``pydoclint`` 0
  violations. No dedicated dashboard pytest module today (covered
  by the ``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/dashboards.md`` playbook); other
  suites unaffected.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 89b: api/main.py jobs + scheduler routes extract

Eleventh decomposition slice for ``api/main.py`` — second cut of
Sprint 89. The full job-scheduler surface moves out: 5 JSON CRUD
routes, 3 run/task introspection routes, 3 papermill artefact
routes, 2 pause/unpause, and 2 HTML pages (jobs list + job detail).
main.py drops 2,406 → 1,674 LOC (-732).

- **New module** [jobs_routes.py](pointlessql/api/jobs_routes.py)
  (803 LOC). 13 routes plus 7 module-level helpers
  (``serialize_job``, ``serialize_task``, ``serialize_task_run``,
  ``serialize_run``, ``latest_run_per_job``, ``load_job_or_404``,
  ``require_job_owner_or_admin``, ``load_papermill_run_output_path``)
  plus the ``JOB_REGISTRY`` module-level constant.

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(jobs_router)``
  next to the other ten routers. ``JOB_REGISTRY`` and
  ``serialize_run`` re-exported from main.py under their legacy
  ``_JOB_REGISTRY`` / ``_serialize_run`` aliases — the still-
  resident dashboard refresh route reads them.

- **Test fix:** ``tests/test_scheduler.py``
  ``test_manual_run_and_pause_unpause`` updated to monkeypatch
  ``api_jobs_routes.JOB_REGISTRY`` instead of the legacy
  ``api_main._JOB_REGISTRY``. Python's local-name lookup means a
  re-export binding in main.py is not what the route handler
  reads — the test must patch the module that owns the symbol.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 25 warnings (unchanged), ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  ``pytest -k 'job or scheduler' --ignore=tests/test_jupyter.py``
  54/54 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 89a: api/main.py federation routes extract

Tenth decomposition slice for ``api/main.py`` — first cut of Sprint
89's federation+jobs+dashboards triple. All UC federation
administration moves out: connections, external-locations,
credentials (5 routes each + 6 HTML pages = 21 routes total).
main.py drops 2,683 → 2,406 LOC (-277).

- **New module** [federation_routes.py](pointlessql/api/federation_routes.py)
  (322 LOC). All 21 routes are ``require_admin``-gated, mirroring
  the soyuz-catalog rule that federation administration is
  admin-only until a finer-grained CREATE_* privilege ships.

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(federation_router)``
  next to the other nine routers.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 25 warnings (-1), ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  ``pytest -k 'connection or credential or federation or
  external' --ignore=tests/test_jupyter.py`` 34/34 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 88b: api/main.py notebook WS endpoints extract

Ninth decomposition slice for ``api/main.py`` — closes out the
notebook surface. The two ``@app.websocket`` handlers
(``/ws/notebook/kernel`` + ``/ws/notebook/lsp``) and their shared
``resolve_sql_approved_tables`` helper move into a dedicated
``notebook_kernel_ws.py``. main.py drops 3,227 → 2,683 LOC (-544).

- **New module** [notebook_kernel_ws.py](pointlessql/api/notebook_kernel_ws.py)
  (601 LOC). Both WS endpoints plus the SQL-approval helper.
  Underscore prefix dropped from helper name
  (``resolve_sql_approved_tables`` is module-public within the
  new package). WS auth model preserved verbatim: cookie + JWT
  decode, traversal guard, 4401/4400/4404/1011 close codes.

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(notebook_ws_router)``
  next to the other eight routers. Now-unused ``contextlib``,
  ``WebSocket``, ``WebSocketDisconnect``, ``UnityCatalogClient``,
  ``UserInfo``, ``check_privilege``, ``SELECT``, plus the
  ``services.pyright_bridge`` import all auto-trimmed by ruff
  (the WS routes were the only remaining callers).

- **WS lifecycle preserved.** All five close codes (4401
  unauthenticated, 4400 bad path, 4404 missing pyright, 1011 spawn
  failure, normal close) plus the ZMQ↔WS forward tasks +
  per-cell output counters + per-execute history-row stamping
  moved verbatim.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 26 warnings (-18 from Sprint 88a because the WS code
  carried 18 partial-unknown warnings), ``pydoclint`` 0
  violations. ``pytest tests/test_api_notebook_workspace.py
  tests/test_notebook_workspace.py`` 27/27 passed. WS endpoints
  have no unit tests; their integration coverage runs through
  ``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook_kernel.md`` (Playwright
  playbook).

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 88a: api/main.py notebook HTTP routes extract

Eighth decomposition slice for ``api/main.py``. The HTTP half of the
notebook surface lifts out: editor page, doc bundle (GET + POST),
per-cell run history, the workspace tree + inspect endpoints, the
upload/create/rename/delete CRUD, and the workspace HTML page.
main.py drops 3,751 → 3,227 LOC (-524). The two WebSocket endpoints
(``/ws/notebook/kernel`` + ``/ws/notebook/lsp``) and their shared
``_resolve_sql_approved_tables`` helper stay in main.py for now —
Sprint 88b will move them into a dedicated WS module.

- **New module** [notebooks_routes.py](pointlessql/api/notebooks_routes.py)
  (580 LOC). Owns 11 routes plus the ``build_notebook_doc_bundle``
  helper shared between the HTML editor and the JSON bundle
  endpoint. All existing admin gates preserved.

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(notebooks_router)``
  next to the other seven routers. Now-unused ``UploadFile``,
  ``File``, ``Form``, ``uuid4``, top-level ``json`` imports
  auto-trimmed by ruff.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 44 warnings (-10 from Sprint 87c baseline because the
  moved notebook code carried 10 partial-unknown warnings),
  ``pydoclint`` 0 violations, ``pytest -k notebook
  --ignore=tests/test_jupyter.py`` 34/34 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 87c: api/main.py governance routes extract

Seventh decomposition slice for ``api/main.py``. The full governance
surface lifts out: table column statistics (Sprint 56),
notebook-from-table scratch helper, catalog create/sync/patch +
schema patch, tags + permissions (get/patch + effective), and
lineage. main.py drops 4,242 → 3,751 LOC (-491).

- **New module** [governance_routes.py](pointlessql/api/governance_routes.py)
  (549 LOC). Owns 14 routes plus ``split_full_name`` and
  ``enforce_table_profile_access`` helpers (underscore prefixes
  dropped).

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(governance_router)``
  next to the other six routers. Module-level ``MODIFY`` import
  dropped (only the moved routes used it).

- **Authorization model preserved.** Profile + stats GET still
  require SELECT (admin short-circuits); stats DELETE +
  open-in-notebook + create-catalog + sync-catalog are still
  admin-only; catalog/schema PATCH still need MODIFY; tag PATCH
  MODIFY; permission PATCH MANAGE_GRANTS; lineage GET SELECT.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 54 warnings (-13 from Sprint 87b baseline because the
  moved governance code carried 13 ``Type … partially unknown``
  warnings), ``pydoclint`` 0 violations, ``pytest -k 'stats or
  table_stats or tag or permission or lineage or open_in_notebook'
  --ignore=tests/test_jupyter.py`` 27/27 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 87b: api/main.py UC volumes routes extract

Sixth decomposition slice for ``api/main.py``. The full UC volumes
surface lifts out: 4 JSON endpoints (browse, upload, delete file +
convert-to-Delta) + 2 HTML pages (volumes list + per-volume detail).
main.py drops 4,717 → 4,242 LOC (-475).

- **New module** [volumes_routes.py](pointlessql/api/volumes_routes.py)
  (527 LOC). Owns 6 routes plus ``soyuz_base_url``,
  ``volume_full_name_split``, ``convert_volume_file_sync``, the
  ``DELTA_PRIMITIVE_TO_UC`` dict + ``delta_field_to_uc``
  field-mapper. Underscore prefixes dropped from helper names;
  the type-mapping pair is re-exported from main.py under its
  legacy ``_DELTA_PRIMITIVE_TO_UC`` / ``_delta_field_to_uc``
  aliases (Invariant 8 of the modularisation plan) so
  ``tests/test_volume_convert_type_mapping.py`` keeps importing
  them from ``pointlessql.api.main``.

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(volumes_router)``
  next to the other five routers. Stale ``_soyuz_base_url`` helper
  deleted (the moved volumes routes were the only callers); top-
  level ``httpx`` import dropped for the same reason.

- **Convert-to-Delta admin gate preserved.** The
  ``api_convert_volume_file_to_delta`` route still calls
  ``require_admin(request)`` before any work, mirroring the
  original behaviour.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 67 warnings (unchanged), ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  ``pytest -k volume --ignore=tests/test_jupyter.py`` 15/15
  passed; the targeted
  ``tests/test_volume_convert_type_mapping.py`` 9/9 passed
  (re-export gate intact).

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 87: api/main.py alerts + feed routes extract

Fifth decomposition slice for ``api/main.py``. The full alerts
surface lifts out: ``/api/alerts`` CRUD (5 routes), the destinations
sub-resource (2 routes), per-user feed-token (2 routes), the two
unauthenticated pull-feed endpoints (``/alerts/feed.atom`` +
``/alerts/feed.json``), and the two HTML pages (``/alerts`` list +
``/alerts/{slug}`` detail). main.py drops 5,256 → 4,717 LOC (-539).

- **New module** [alerts_routes.py](pointlessql/api/alerts_routes.py)
  (585 LOC). Owns 13 routes plus three module-level helpers
  (``base_url``, ``rotate_or_fetch_feed_token``,
  ``user_for_feed_token``). Underscore prefixes dropped from
  helpers; ``saved_queries_service`` imported at module level for
  the alerts list page (which renders the dropdown of available
  saved-queries to attach an alert to).

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(alerts_router)``
  next to the other four routers. Unused ``saved_queries_service``
  + ``JSONResponse`` imports removed (the alerts routes were the
  only remaining callers).

- **Feed-token auth preserved.** ``PUBLIC_PREFIXES`` in
  ``api/middleware.py`` already exempts ``/alerts/feed.atom`` +
  ``/alerts/feed.json`` from session auth so the route handlers
  can authenticate via the opaque ``?token=…`` query string and
  401 on mismatch.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 67 warnings (unchanged), ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  ``pytest -k alert --ignore=tests/test_jupyter.py`` 19/19
  passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 86c: api/main.py queries + saved-queries extract

Fourth decomposition slice for ``api/main.py`` — completes the
original Sprint-86 plan. The query-history read endpoints
(``/api/queries`` list/get/chart-config), the ``/queries`` HTML page,
and the full ``/api/saved-queries`` CRUD all move into a new
``api/queries_routes.py``. main.py drops 5,652 → 5,256 LOC (-396).

- **New module** [queries_routes.py](pointlessql/api/queries_routes.py)
  (444 LOC). Owns three query-history routes + the ``/queries``
  HTML page + five saved-queries routes (list/create + get/patch/
  delete by slug) + the ``parse_since`` window-string helper.
  Underscore prefix dropped from ``parse_since`` since it is now
  module-public within the new package.

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(queries_router)``
  next to the other three routers. Module-level imports of
  ``query_history`` + ``saved_queries`` services dropped — the
  alerts route already function-locally re-imports ``saved_queries``
  so nothing else regressed.

- **Visibility model preserved.** Non-admin still sees only their
  own ``query_history`` rows (``user_id`` query param clamped
  server-side); saved queries still 404 on missing OR forbidden so
  private slugs are not discoverable; chart config + delete still
  owner+admin only.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 67 warnings (-7 from Sprint 86b baseline because the
  dropped ``query_history`` + ``saved_queries`` module-level
  imports were the source of seven ``Type … partially unknown``
  warnings), ``pydoclint`` 0 violations, ``pytest -k 'saved_quer
  or query_history or queries' --ignore=tests/test_jupyter.py``
  26/26 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 86b: api/main.py SQL editor routes extract

Third decomposition slice for ``api/main.py``. The four-route
Phase-12 SQL editor surface (execute / cancel / download + the
``/sql`` page) moved into a new module. Original Sprint-86 plan
bundled SQL with ``/api/queries`` + ``/api/saved-queries``; this
slice carved off the SQL pieces alone for a smaller blast radius.
main.py drops 6,203 → 5,652 LOC (-551).

- **New module** [sql_routes.py](pointlessql/api/sql_routes.py)
  (597 LOC). Owns ``POST /api/sql/execute``,
  ``POST /api/sql/execute/{query_id}/cancel``,
  ``GET  /api/sql/execute/{history_id}/download``, and the
  ``GET /sql`` HTML page, plus the four module-level helpers
  (``short_sql_hash``, ``run_sql_sync``, ``live_queries``,
  ``run_sql_export_sync``). Underscore prefixes dropped since the
  helpers are now module-public within the new package.

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(sql_router)``
  alongside the existing auth + catalog routers. Unused
  ``record_query_async`` re-import dropped (the SQL routes were the
  only main.py callers). ``_parse_since`` deliberately stays in
  main.py because ``/api/queries`` (Sprint 86c) still depends on it.

- **Authorization preserved.** Both execute and download still
  re-run ``check_privilege(SELECT)`` per referenced 3-part table —
  a stale ``query_history`` row is not a bypass. The cancel route
  stays idempotent (204 on unknown ids).

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 74 pre-existing warnings, ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  ``pytest -k 'sql or query' --ignore=tests/test_jupyter.py`` 48/48
  passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 86: api/main.py catalog tree routes extract

Second decomposition slice for ``api/main.py``. Narrowed from the
sketched ``catalog/sql/queries`` triple-extract down to just the five
catalog tree routes — the lowest-risk surface in the route set, used
to validate the ``APIRouter`` extraction pattern before the much
larger SQL execute + queries-page extracts in the next sprint.
main.py drops 6,347 → 6,203 LOC (-144).

- **New module** [catalog_routes.py](pointlessql/api/catalog_routes.py)
  (186 LOC). Owns the five sidebar/breadcrumb endpoints
  (``/api/tree``, ``/api/catalogs``,
  ``/api/catalogs/{c}/schemas``,
  ``/api/catalogs/{c}/schemas/{s}/tables``,
  ``/api/catalogs/{c}/schemas/{s}/tables/{t}/preview``) plus the two
  preview helpers (``preview_head`` engine-aware row truncation,
  ``run_table_preview`` thread-pool worker) and the
  ``PREVIEW_ROW_LIMIT = 10`` constant. Underscores dropped from the
  helper names since they are now module-public within the new package.

- **Mount point** in
  [main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py): ``app.include_router(catalog_router)``
  added next to the existing ``auth_router`` line. Unused
  ``make_principal_client`` import removed (only the moved preview
  code referenced it).

- **Authorization preserved.** Schemas + tables endpoints still call
  hierarchical ``check_privilege`` (USE_CATALOG / USE_SCHEMA),
  preview still resolves ``effective_permissions`` once and feeds
  ``check_privilege_from_effective(SELECT)``. Preview responses keep
  ``Cache-Control: no-store`` so revoked grants do not leak through
  the browser disk cache.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright`` 0
  errors / 74 pre-existing warnings, ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  ``pytest -k 'catalog or tree or preview'
  --ignore=tests/test_jupyter.py`` 44/44 passed (test_jupyter.py has a
  pre-existing import error unrelated to this sprint).

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 85: api/main.py middleware + helpers extract

First decomposition slice for the 6,599-LOC ``api/main.py``. The
lowest-risk pieces — middleware stack + per-request dependencies +
async fire-and-forget audit/query-history writers — moved into three
new modules. main.py drops 6,599 → 6,341 LOC (-258); no route logic
moved this sprint.

- **New modules** under ``pointlessql/api/``:
  [middleware.py](pointlessql/api/middleware.py) (~155 LOC) — five
  middleware functions wired into a single
  ``register_middleware(app)`` entrypoint that preserves the
  LIFO stacking order (``request_id → static_revalidate → csrf →
  rate_limit → auth → handler`` on every incoming request).
  ``PUBLIC_PREFIXES`` lifted out of its underscore-prefixed private
  name since the new module owns it.
  [dependencies.py](pointlessql/api/dependencies.py) (~90 LOC) —
  request-scoped helpers ``get_uc_client`` / ``get_user`` /
  ``require_admin`` / ``client_ip``. main.py re-imports them with
  the legacy ``_get_user`` etc. aliases so the ~hundred call sites
  inside its route handlers keep working unchanged.
  [_audit_helpers.py](pointlessql/api/_audit_helpers.py) (~130 LOC)
  — ``audit`` + ``record_query_async`` async writers, pulled out
  so route-group modules in Sprints 86-90 can import them without
  dragging in the full main module.

- **Middleware order preserved.** ``register_middleware`` calls
  ``app.middleware("http")()`` in the exact same order the decorators
  previously fired in main.py, so the LIFO execution chain on an
  incoming request is byte-identical to the pre-Sprint-85 build.

- **Public surface preserved.** Every existing call into the helpers
  works through the legacy underscore-prefixed re-imports
  (``_get_uc_client``, ``_get_user``, ``_require_admin``,
  ``_record_query_async``, ``_audit``) at the top of main.py, so
  the route handlers below — which still total >5,000 LOC — were
  not touched at all.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright``
  0 errors / 74 pre-existing warnings, ``pytest tests/test_csrf.py
  tests/test_rate_limit.py tests/test_auth.py`` 52/52 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 84: services/scheduler.py → 5-module package

Eighth backend split — largest service (1,776 LOC). The
``services/scheduler.py`` module became the package
``services/scheduler/`` with five sibling modules carved along the
pipeline boundaries (registry → executors → DAG → runs → loop).

- **Package layout** under ``pointlessql/services/scheduler/``:
  [registry.py](pointlessql/services/scheduler/registry.py) (~95 LOC)
  — ``KindRegistry``, ``JobExecutor`` type alias,
  ``build_default_registry``.
  [executors.py](pointlessql/services/scheduler/executors.py)
  (~555 LOC) — the four built-in executors
  (``_pg_sync_executor``, ``_python_executor``,
  ``_papermill_executor`` + helpers, ``_alert_check_executor``).
  Function-local imports for ``pql.pql`` / ``alerts`` / ``models``
  / ``authorization`` are preserved verbatim — the pre-Sprint-84
  code dodged a circular chain through ``pointlessql.db`` and the
  same pattern continues to work.
  [dag.py](pointlessql/services/scheduler/dag.py) (~135 LOC) —
  pure graph algorithms: ``validate_dag`` (cycle detection),
  ``_topological_order`` (Kahn's algorithm), ``_parse_depends_on``.
  [runs.py](pointlessql/services/scheduler/runs.py) (~825 LOC) —
  DB helpers, ``log_job``, per-task lifecycle (``_run_one_task``,
  ``_run_dag``), run orchestration (``execute_run`` +
  ``_execute_run_core``), telemetry helpers. Owns the test-hook
  globals ``_sleep`` / ``_webhook_client_factory`` /
  ``_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``.
  [loop.py](pointlessql/services/scheduler/loop.py) (~250 LOC) —
  ``tick_once``, ``_execute_with_semaphores``, the ``Scheduler``
  driver class.

- **Public surface preserved.** The package
  [__init__.py](pointlessql/services/scheduler/__init__.py)
  re-exports every name the API layer
  ([pointlessql/api/main.py:55](pointlessql/api/main.py#L55)),
  scheduler tests, and external docs reference (``KindRegistry``,
  ``Scheduler``, ``build_default_registry``, ``execute_run``,
  ``tick_once``, ``validate_dag``, ``log_job``,
  ``_alert_check_executor``, ``_papermill_executor``,
  ``resolve_notebook_path``, ``_is_due``,
  ``_execute_with_semaphores``, ``_WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``,
  ``_sleep``, ``_webhook_client_factory``).

- **Test-hook patch sites moved.** 6 monkeypatch sites across
  ``tests/test_scheduler_dag.py`` (``_sleep``) and
  ``tests/test_metrics.py`` (``_webhook_client_factory``) now patch
  ``scheduler_service.runs._sleep`` /
  ``scheduler_service.runs._webhook_client_factory`` directly. The
  runs.py module reads them via local-name lookup, so monkeypatching
  the package-level re-export does not take effect — the right
  structural fix is to patch the module where the symbol is used.

- **Per-file pyright suppressions.** Added ``# pyright:
  reportPrivateUsage=false`` to ``__init__.py``, ``loop.py``,
  ``registry.py``, and ``runs.py``; and ``# pyright:
  reportUnusedFunction=false`` to ``executors.py``, ``dag.py``,
  and ``runs.py``. Pyright's strict-mode rules treat any
  underscore-prefixed cross-module access as private leakage —
  legitimate within a single package, and the public contract
  (``__all__`` lists, the test patches) is what actually
  constrains the surface.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright``
  0 errors / 15 pre-existing warnings, ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  ``pytest tests/test_scheduler.py tests/test_scheduler_dag.py
  tests/test_metrics.py tests/test_alerts.py
  tests/test_scheduler_papermill.py`` 80/80 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 83: services/unitycatalog.py → mixin package

Seventh backend split — broadest blast radius of the arc (18+ call
sites, 23 tests patch soyuz function names by string). The 783-LOC
``services/unitycatalog.py`` module became the package
``services/unitycatalog/`` with one mixin per securable type plus a
shared ``_api.py`` for the soyuz function bindings + error decorator.
``UnityCatalogClient`` composes the mixins so its single-import
surface (``from pointlessql.services.unitycatalog import
UnityCatalogClient``) is unchanged.

- **Package layout** under ``pointlessql/services/unitycatalog/``:
  [_api.py](pointlessql/services/unitycatalog/_api.py) (~190 LOC) —
  every soyuz typed function imported as ``_get_X`` / ``_create_X``
  / ``_list_X`` / ``_update_X`` / ``_delete_X``, plus the shared
  ``wrap_catalog_errors`` decorator.
  [_catalogs.py](pointlessql/services/unitycatalog/_catalogs.py)
  (~130 LOC) — ``CatalogsMixin`` (catalog CRUD + ``get_tree``
  aggregator that reaches into ``MetadataMixin.list_schemas`` /
  ``list_tables`` via ``self``).
  [_metadata.py](pointlessql/services/unitycatalog/_metadata.py)
  (~210 LOC) — ``MetadataMixin`` (schema + table + tag CRUD).
  [_permissions.py](pointlessql/services/unitycatalog/_permissions.py)
  (~110 LOC) — ``PermissionsMixin`` (direct + effective).
  [_lineage.py](pointlessql/services/unitycatalog/_lineage.py)
  (~50 LOC) — ``LineageMixin``.
  [_federation.py](pointlessql/services/unitycatalog/_federation.py)
  (~180 LOC) — ``FederationMixin`` (connections + external locations
  + credentials).

- **Test patch surface preserved.** The package
  [__init__.py](pointlessql/services/unitycatalog/__init__.py)
  re-exports every soyuz function binding at the legacy
  ``pointlessql.services.unitycatalog._xyz`` path. Tests that do
  ``patch("pointlessql.services.unitycatalog._get_tags.asyncio")``
  hit the same module object the mixin's call resolves to (Python
  module objects are singletons), so 23 patch sites in
  ``test_tags_permissions.py`` + ``test_federation.py`` work
  unchanged.

- **Renamed ``_wrap_catalog_errors`` → ``wrap_catalog_errors``.** Same
  reason the Sprint-77 kernel_session + Sprint-81 alerts + Sprint-82
  pg_sync splits dropped their leading underscores from cross-module
  helpers: pyright's ``reportPrivateUsage`` flags any access from a
  non-owning module, and the decorator is now used by every mixin.

- **MRO verified:** ``UnityCatalogClient → CatalogsMixin →
  MetadataMixin → PermissionsMixin → LineageMixin → FederationMixin
  → object``. ``isinstance(client, UnityCatalogClient)`` still works
  for every existing call site.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright``
  0 errors / 4 warnings (3 pre-existing isinstance/list-typing
  patterns, unchanged), ``pydoclint`` 0 violations, ``pytest
  tests/test_tags_permissions.py tests/test_federation.py`` 23/23 +
  ``pytest tests/test_pg_sync.py tests/test_foreign_catalog.py
  tests/test_e2e.py tests/test_problem_json.py`` 60/60 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 82: services/pg_sync.py → 5-module package

Sixth backend split. The 778-LOC ``services/pg_sync.py`` module became
the package ``services/pg_sync/`` with five sibling modules carved
along the pipeline boundaries (introspect → diff → apply → record).

- [types.py](pointlessql/services/pg_sync/types.py) (~250 LOC) —
  dataclasses (``PgColumn``, ``PgTable``, ``PostgresSnapshot``,
  ``UcColumn``, ``UcTable``, ``SyncDiff``), the ``PG_TO_UC_TYPE`` map,
  ``map_pg_type_to_uc``, the ``PostgresIntrospector`` Protocol, plus
  the ``EXTERNAL_TABLE_TYPE`` / ``FOREIGN_DATA_SOURCE_FORMAT``
  constants (renamed from underscore-prefixed since they now travel
  cross-module).
- [dsn.py](pointlessql/services/pg_sync/dsn.py) (~80 LOC) —
  ``effective_options`` (renamed from ``_effective_options``) +
  ``build_dsn``.
- [snapshot.py](pointlessql/services/pg_sync/snapshot.py) (~95 LOC) —
  ``PsycopgIntrospector`` (the live-Postgres concrete implementation).
- [diff.py](pointlessql/services/pg_sync/diff.py) (~210 LOC) — pure
  ``diff_snapshots`` + ``collect_uc_tables`` + ``apply_diff`` plus the
  ``_columns_payload`` / ``_storage_location_stub`` helpers (still
  underscored because they remain internal to ``apply_diff``).
- [runs.py](pointlessql/services/pg_sync/runs.py) (~165 LOC) —
  ``run_sync`` end-to-end orchestration + ``list_recent_runs`` +
  ``_start_run`` / ``_finish_run`` bookkeeping.

- **Public surface preserved.** The package
  [__init__.py](pointlessql/services/pg_sync/__init__.py) re-exports
  every name the API layer
  ([pointlessql/api/main.py:51](pointlessql/api/main.py#L51)),
  scheduler
  ([pointlessql/services/scheduler.py:178](pointlessql/services/scheduler.py#L178)),
  and tests
  ([tests/test_pg_sync.py:33](tests/test_pg_sync.py#L33),
  [tests/test_scheduler.py:314](tests/test_scheduler.py#L314)) need.

- **One test rename.** ``_effective_options`` →
  ``effective_options`` in ``tests/test_pg_sync.py`` is the only
  compensation needed for the split — the production code's leading
  underscore is misleading once the symbol is imported across modules
  (same lesson the Sprint-77 kernel_session split made explicit).

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright``
  0 errors / 8 warnings (all pre-existing dict-unpack patterns in
  ``collect_uc_tables``), ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  ``pytest tests/test_pg_sync.py`` 46/46 passed (1 deselected: live
  integration test).

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 81: services/alerts.py → 4-module package

Fifth backend split. The 729-LOC ``services/alerts.py`` module became
the package ``services/alerts/`` with four sibling modules + an
``__init__.py`` re-export shim. Pure structural refactor; no
schema, no migration, no behaviour change.

- **Four-bucket split** along the concern boundaries the file already
  implied:
  [crud.py](pointlessql/services/alerts/crud.py) (~340 LOC) — slug /
  serialisation / authorisation helpers, backing-Job lifecycle
  (``_sync_backing_job``), CRUD (``create_alert``, ``list_visible``,
  ``get_by_slug``, ``update_by_slug``, ``delete_by_slug``).
  [destinations.py](pointlessql/services/alerts/destinations.py)
  (~100 LOC) — ``add_destination`` + ``delete_destination``.
  [events.py](pointlessql/services/alerts/events.py) (~165 LOC) —
  ``record_event`` + ``set_event_outcome`` +
  ``list_events_for_alert`` + ``list_events_for_owner`` +
  ``prune_events_older_than``.
  [conditions.py](pointlessql/services/alerts/conditions.py) (~85 LOC)
  — pure ``evaluate_condition`` + ``build_cloudevent``.

- **Cross-module helpers de-underscored.** Renamed ``_serialize`` →
  ``serialize``, ``_serialize_destination`` → ``serialize_destination``,
  ``_can_mutate`` → ``can_mutate``: the leading underscore conveyed
  file-private scope, which is no longer accurate now that
  ``destinations.py`` imports them across modules. Same lesson the
  Sprint-77 kernel_session split made explicit. ``_sync_backing_job``
  stays underscored because it's truly internal to ``crud.py``.

- **Public surface preserved.** Existing ``from pointlessql.services
  import alerts as alerts_service`` callers (API layer line 1693,
  scheduler line 543, tests/test_alerts.py line 19) keep working
  through the package's ``__init__.py`` re-exports.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright``
  0 errors / 0 warnings, ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  ``pytest tests/test_alerts.py`` 19/19 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 80: models.py → 8-module package

Fourth backend split — by far the highest-stakes mechanical refactor
of the arc. The 952-LOC ``models.py`` became the package
``pointlessql/models/`` with one module per domain. Alembic and the
32 known call sites continue to work unchanged via package-level
re-exports. Pure structural refactor; no schema, no migration, no
behaviour change.

- **Package layout.** Module order is load-bearing: SQLAlchemy
  resolves ``ForeignKey("table.col")`` strings at mapper-config time,
  so referenced tables must register before referrers.
  [base.py](pointlessql/models/base.py) (Base);
  [auth.py](pointlessql/models/auth.py) (User);
  [audit.py](pointlessql/models/audit.py) (AuditLog);
  [sync.py](pointlessql/models/sync.py) (SyncRun);
  [scheduler.py](pointlessql/models/scheduler.py) (Job, JobRun,
  JobTask, TaskRun, JobLog);
  [catalog.py](pointlessql/models/catalog.py) (Dashboard,
  QueryHistory, QueryHistoryTable, SavedQuery, TableStats,
  RateLimitEvent);
  [alerts.py](pointlessql/models/alerts.py) (Alert, AlertDestination,
  AlertEvent);
  [notebook.py](pointlessql/models/notebook.py) (NotebookOutput,
  NotebookCellRun, NotebookCellRunSource).

- **Alembic compatibility.**
  [pointlessql/alembic/env.py:6](pointlessql/alembic/env.py#L6) still
  imports ``from pointlessql.models import Base`` and resolves to the
  same metadata. Migration files reference table names (strings) not
  Python classes, so they were untouched. Smoke import confirms all
  20 tables register on ``Base.metadata`` after the split.

- **Public surface preserved.**
  [__init__.py](pointlessql/models/__init__.py) re-exports every
  symbol previously importable from ``pointlessql.models``, so the
  32 known call sites (services, API layer, tests, alembic) work
  unchanged.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright``
  0 errors / 0 warnings, ``pydoclint`` 0 violations, model-touching
  test suites pass.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 79: services/notebook_outputs.py → 2-module package

Third backend split. The 480-LOC ``services/notebook_outputs.py``
module became the package ``services/notebook_outputs/`` with two
sibling modules + an ``__init__.py`` re-export shim. Pure structural
refactor; no SQL, no schema, no behaviour change.

- **Two-bucket split** along the underlying-table boundary that the
  monolithic file already implied:
  [outputs.py](pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs/outputs.py)
  (~270 LOC) owns the ``NotebookOutput`` table — append-on-iopub,
  replay-on-open, plus the cross-table ``clear_*`` / ``rename_path``
  helpers that scrub output frames and cell-run lifecycle rows
  together on re-execute, restart, delete, or rename.
  [cell_runs.py](pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs/cell_runs.py)
  (~210 LOC) owns the ``NotebookCellRun`` (current state per session)
  and ``NotebookCellRunSource`` (per-execute history) tables —
  ``upsert_cell_run``, ``record_cell_run_start`` / ``_finish``,
  ``list_cell_run_sources``.

- **Public surface preserved.**
  [__init__.py](pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs/__init__.py)
  re-exports every function the API layer uses, so the lone
  external caller
  [pointlessql/api/main.py:48](pointlessql/api/main.py#L48)
  keeps working through ``notebook_outputs_service.X`` access.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright``
  0 errors / 0 warnings, ``pydoclint`` 0 violations, smoke import
  OK.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 78: pql/pql.py → 5 sibling helpers

Second backend split. The 461-LOC ``PQL`` module is now a 192-LOC
public-class façade plus five per-concern sibling modules.
:class:`PQL`'s methods are thin wrappers that delegate to module-level
helper functions; the orchestration shape (init → method dispatch) is
readable in one file while the per-concern logic — Delta read, DuckDB
SQL execution, Delta write + table-creation, list helpers — lives
next door.

- **New helpers** under ``pointlessql/pql/``:
  [_types.py](pointlessql/pql/_types.py) (44 LOC) carries
  ``SQLResult``;
  [_read.py](pointlessql/pql/_read.py) (64 LOC) is ``read_table()``
  (the body of ``PQL.table``);
  [_sql.py](pointlessql/pql/_sql.py) (124 LOC) is ``run_sql()`` (the
  body of ``PQL.sql`` — DuckDB connect + view registration + execute
  + row cap);
  [_write.py](pointlessql/pql/_write.py) (132 LOC) is
  ``write_table()`` + ``derive_storage_location()`` (the body of
  ``PQL.write_table``);
  [_list.py](pointlessql/pql/_list.py) (80 LOC) is ``list_catalogs``
  / ``list_schemas`` / ``list_tables``.

- **Public surface preserved.** :class:`PQL` keeps every method
  signature it had; ``SQLResult`` is re-exported from
  [pql.py](pointlessql/pql/pql.py) so existing
  ``from pointlessql.pql.pql import SQLResult`` callers (notably
  [tests/test_alerts.py:417](tests/test_alerts.py#L417)) resolve
  unchanged.

- **Tests updated, not the production code.** Added ``_READ`` /
  ``_WRITE`` / ``_LIST`` constants alongside the existing ``_MOD``
  in [tests/test_pql.py](tests/test_pql.py) and re-pointed every
  ``@patch`` to the module that now owns the symbol (e.g.
  ``_get_table`` is monkeypatched on
  ``pointlessql.pql._read`` for read tests and on
  ``pointlessql.pql._write`` for write tests). Internal mocks
  must follow the implementation when the implementation is
  intentionally split — the alternative (re-importing soyuz-client
  internals back into ``pql.py`` purely for the test surface) would
  defeat the split.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright``
  0 errors / 32 warnings (all pre-existing
  ``engine.py`` polars/pyarrow untyped-arg warnings), ``pydoclint``
  0 violations, ``pytest tests/test_pql.py tests/test_alerts.py``
  51/51 passed.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 77: services/kernel_session.py → package

Pilot of the backend modularization arc (Sprints 77-90). The single
472-LOC ``services/kernel_session.py`` module became the package
``services/kernel_session/`` with three sibling modules + an
``__init__.py`` re-export shim. No behaviour change, no Alembic, no
new dependencies; pure structural refactor.

- **New package layout.**
  [messages.py](pointlessql/services/kernel_session/messages.py)
  (61 LOC) carries ``KernelMessage`` and ``Subscription``
  dataclasses + the ``_SUBSCRIBER_QUEUE_MAXSIZE`` constant.
  [session.py](pointlessql/services/kernel_session/session.py)
  (337 LOC) owns the ``KernelSession`` lifecycle, ZMQ pump
  tasks, bootstrap helper code, and the
  ``_KERNEL_READY_TIMEOUT``/``_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT``/``_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT``
  constants.
  [registry.py](pointlessql/services/kernel_session/registry.py)
  (94 LOC) owns ``KernelRegistry`` + the ``drain`` async iterator.

- **Public surface preserved.** The lone external caller
  [pointlessql/api/main.py:45](pointlessql/api/main.py#L45)
  imports the module as ``kernel_session_service`` and accesses
  ``KernelRegistry``, ``KernelMessage``, ``KernelSession``,
  ``drain`` through that namespace. The new
  [__init__.py](pointlessql/services/kernel_session/__init__.py)
  re-exports the full surface so the import resolves unchanged.
  No tests directly import this module.

- **Renamed ``_Subscription`` → ``Subscription``.** The leading
  underscore conveyed file-private scope, which is no longer
  accurate now that ``KernelSession`` imports it across modules.
  Pyright's ``reportPrivateUsage`` rule flagged this immediately
  on the first split attempt.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff`` 0 errors, ``pyright``
  0 errors / 5 warnings (all from ``jupyter_client``'s partially-
  unknown async types — pre-existing), ``pydoclint`` 0 violations,
  smoke import via ``python -c "from pointlessql.services import
  kernel_session"``.

### Refactored — Phase 12.9 / Sprint 76: notebook/main.js → 4 sub-modules + toast helper

Follow-up to Phase 12.8.  Four sibling modules carved out of
notebook/main.js and a cross-cutting toast-guard cleanup across
sql_editor.js, notebook/main.js, and notebook/editor_shell.js.  No
behaviour change, no Alembic, no template-structure change; pure JS
refactor.

- **Notebook main.js split.**
  [main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js) drops 1204 → 703 LOC
  (-501).  Four new sibling modules:
  [kernel_ws.js](frontend/js/notebook/kernel_ws.js) (211 LOC) owns
  the ipykernel socket + frame routing;
  [lsp_ws.js](frontend/js/notebook/lsp_ws.js) (133 LOC) owns the
  pyright socket + didOpen + notifyDidChange;
  [cell_scanner.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_scanner.js) (41 LOC)
  holds pure scanCellRanges + rangesToDecorations;
  [cell_editor.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_editor.js) (104 LOC)
  holds insertCellAfter + addCellBelow + addCellAbove +
  applyResultVarToMarker.  main.js now owns orchestration glue +
  rebuildCellAffordances + save + catalog-insert only.

- **Toast-guard cleanup (Tranche 7).**
  [api.js](frontend/js/api.js) exports ``toast(variant, msg)`` and
  ``csrfToken()`` as named exports.  14 ``if (window.pqlToast)
  window.pqlToast.X(msg)`` guards in
  [sql_editor.js](frontend/js/sql_editor.js),
  [notebook/main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js), and
  [notebook/editor_shell.js](frontend/js/notebook/editor_shell.js)
  replaced with single-line ``toast('error', msg)`` calls.  The
  helper no-ops when the singleton is missing, so call-sites read
  top-down without branch noise.  Duplicate ``csrfToken()`` removed
  from notebook/main.js.

- **Cache-bust bumped** to ``?v=sprint76`` on the
  [notebook_editor.html](frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  bootstrap script tag so browsers pick up the new ESM import graph
  without a hard reload.

- **Deferred to a follow-up sprint:** ``mount_bootstrap.js`` split
  (mount() is tightly coupled to ``this`` + the Alpine factory return
  object; extracting it means refactoring the factory shape, not a
  mechanical move).  Captured in the tranche plan at
  ``~/.claude/plans/wir-haben-in-diesem-warm-dream.md``.

- **Static gates (all green):** ``ruff``, ``pyright`` (0 errors),
  ``pydoclint``,
  [check-frontend-bootstrap-order.sh](scripts/check-frontend-bootstrap-order.sh),
  [check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh),
  ``node --check`` on every modified JS file, import-graph resolution
  check, Jinja template parse.

### Refactored — Phase 12.8 / Sprint 75: Frontend cleanup (notebook carve-up + ESM-everywhere + CSS-split + CSRF + README)

One-shot reorg sprint that clears the JS / CSS organisation debt
before Phase 13 starts.  No new feature; no behaviour change beyond
the latent CSRF fix.  Six commits, one per phase, all on main.

- **Phase 1 — notebook/main.js carve-up** (247e271).
  [main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js) drops 1547 → 1204 LOC.
  Five new sibling modules:
  [output_zone_manager.js](frontend/js/notebook/output_zone_manager.js),
  [cell_introspector.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_introspector.js),
  [autosave_scheduler.js](frontend/js/notebook/autosave_scheduler.js),
  [commands.js](frontend/js/notebook/commands.js); plus
  ``createOutlineRecomputer`` factory in
  [outline.js](frontend/js/notebook/outline.js).  Grep gate
  [check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  extended with the new closure-state slot names.

- **Phase 2 — ESM bridge entrypoint** (87f03a7).  New
  [frontend/js/bootstrap.js](frontend/js/bootstrap.js) loaded as
  ``<script type="module">`` from
  [base.html](frontend/templates/base.html) before the Alpine CDN
  script.  New CI gate
  [check-frontend-bootstrap-order.sh](scripts/check-frontend-bootstrap-order.sh)
  asserts the script-tag ordering.

- **Phase 3 — editor_base + small editors to ESM** (410f144).  New
  [editor_base.js](frontend/js/editor_base.js) exports
  ``validateRequired`` and ``createDictEditor``; four inline editors
  migrated to native ES modules.

- **Phase 4 — federation / list_table / sql_editor / helpers to ESM**
  (2d9e1e2).  Last legacy files migrated.  Removed all 11 individual
  ``<script src="/static/js/X.js">`` tags from base.html +
  sql_editor.html — only bootstrap.js + Alpine + vendor CDN scripts
  load via raw ``<script>`` now.

- **Phase 5 — CSRF in pqlApi + frontend README** (a5a7a20).
  ``pqlApi.fetch`` now injects ``X-CSRF-Token`` for non-safe verbs.
  New [frontend/js/README.md](frontend/js/README.md) documents the
  post-Sprint-75 conventions.

- **Phase 6 — style.css split** (e0ae139).  1066-line single file
  carved into ten purpose-scoped sheets that the master
  [style.css](frontend/css/style.css) ``@import``s in cascade order:
  base / primitives / layout / responsive plus six under
  components/.

Hard constraints honoured: no build step, no bundler, no
``package.json``.  Static gates green: ruff, pyright, alembic,
``node --check`` on every modified file, both frontend grep gates.

### Fixed — Phase 12.7 tail: BUG-71-02 + BUG-72-01 root fix + replay completion

Closing audit pass on the Phase-12.7 sprints surfaced two bugs
the in-sprint replays missed; both fixed in a single follow-up
commit.

**BUG-71-02 — server-side notebook_doc dropped the [sql] tag +
result_var on round-trip.**  Sprint 71's frontend correctly
emitted ``# %% [sql] pql_cell_id="…" result_var="…"`` markers,
but the server-side
[notebook_doc.py](pointlessql/services/notebook_doc.py) used
jupytext for both load and save; jupytext only recognises
``[markdown]`` as a cell-type tag — anything else (``[sql]``,
``[raw]``, …) is silently dropped from the marker line, and the
cell is parsed as a plain code cell.  The ``result_var`` segment
was equally invisible.  Saving was rejected outright by the
server validator (``cell_type='sql'`` not in the allow-list).
Result: editor showed SQL cells as code cells on reload, autosave
silently failed for SQL cells.  Fix:

- Extended ``NotebookCell`` with ``result_var: str | None``.
- Added module-level ``_PQL_MARKER_RE`` mirroring the
  client-side ``CELL_MARKER_RE`` in
  [cell_parser.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_parser.js).
- ``load_document`` post-parses the raw .py file with the regex
  to recover ``[sql]`` tags + ``result_var`` segments and
  overrides the cell type jupytext returned.
- ``save_document`` post-writes via a new ``_rewrite_sql_markers``
  helper that rewrites code-cell markers for SQL cells back to
  ``# %% [sql] pql_cell_id="…" result_var="…"``.
- ``api_save_notebook_doc`` accepts ``cell_type='sql'`` + reads
  optional ``result_var``.
- ``api_load_notebook_doc`` includes ``result_var`` in the
  bundle for every cell.
- [main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js) normalises
  ``result_var`` ↔ ``resultVar`` at the wire boundary on both
  load and save so the rest of the JS-side cell shape stays in
  one consistent form.

**BUG-72-01 root fix.**  The Sprint-72 commit's "workaround"
claim — that bumping bootstrap.js's ``?v=`` query busts the
inner ESM imports — was wrong; that param only invalidates
bootstrap.js itself, not the dynamically-imported siblings.  Real
fix: a new HTTP middleware
[``static_module_revalidate_middleware``](pointlessql/api/main.py)
stamps ``Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate`` on every
``/static/js/notebook/*`` response, so the browser must issue a
conditional ``If-Modified-Since`` request next time.  Starlette's
StaticFiles answers 304 when unchanged (cheap); a sprint-fresh
module is delivered immediately on the next page load — no
hard-reload needed.  Sprint 72's "What the replay caught"
section in
[docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md)
is also corrected to reflect the real fix.

**Replay completion** for the Sprint-71 / -72 / -73 / -74
playbook steps that the in-sprint walkthroughs had skipped (L6,
L7, L8, L9, M1-M5, N6, N7, N8, O3, O5, O6).  Documented in the
new "Phase 12.7 tail" block at the end of
[notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md).

### Added (Sprint 74) — Phase 12.7: Settings drawer + keymap overlay + phase close

Tenth and final Phase 12.7 sprint.  Settings drawer (theme,
font-size, autosave-debounce knob), ``Ctrl+Alt+/`` keymap overlay
listing every editor command, four new ``pql.*`` palette actions,
and the Phase-12.7 ROADMAP node flips ``⏳ open`` → ``✅ done``.

- [frontend/js/notebook/settings_drawer.js](frontend/js/notebook/settings_drawer.js)
  — new module.  Bootstrap offcanvas with ``Theme`` (``vs-dark`` /
  ``vs`` / ``hc-black``), ``Font size`` (10-22 px), ``Autosave
  debounce`` (200-2000 ms).  Persists to localStorage under
  ``pql.nbedit.theme.v1`` / ``pql.nbedit.fontSize.v1`` /
  ``pql.nbedit.autosave.debounceMs.v1``; broadcasts a
  ``pql:settings-changed`` ``CustomEvent`` on ``document`` so
  every open tab's editor re-applies via
  ``monaco.editor.setTheme`` (page-global) +
  ``editor.updateOptions({fontSize})`` (per-instance) + a
  ``_autosaveDebounceMs`` closure mutation.
- [frontend/js/notebook/keymap_overlay.js](frontend/js/notebook/keymap_overlay.js)
  — new module.  Static 15-row commands array (Sprint 62 +
  70 + 73 + 74 additions), Bootstrap modal renderer reachable via
  the ``?`` toolbar button, the ``Ctrl+Alt+/`` keybind, and the
  ``pql.openKeymap`` palette action.  ``Ctrl+/`` left bound to
  Monaco's default ``toggle-line-comment`` to avoid shadowing the
  editor convention.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — applies ``loadSettings()`` on Monaco create; lifts
  ``_autosaveDebounceMs`` out of module scope so
  ``scheduleAutosave`` reads it at flush-queue time;
  ``registerPaletteActions`` extended with
  ``pql.toggleOutline`` / ``pql.openHistory`` /
  ``pql.openSettings`` / ``pql.openKeymap`` (last is also bound to
  ``Ctrl+Alt+/``); new Alpine methods ``openSettings`` /
  ``openKeymap`` / ``openHistoryForCurrentCell``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js](frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js)
  — extended the tab-scope stub with ``outlineVisible`` /
  ``outline`` and the four new method names so the pre-mount
  window no longer raises ``ReferenceError`` on Alpine
  ``x-show`` / ``@click`` expressions.  Cleaned up the
  Sprint-72-era console-noise tail.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — gear (⚙) + ``?`` toolbar buttons; bootstrap.js script tag
  bumped to ``?v=sprint74``.

**BUG-74-01 (replay-caught + fixed in same commit):** double-
backticks inside an HTML template literal in
``buildModal`` (the GitHub-flavoured-markdown-style ``\`\`pql.*\`\```
text in the modal footer) terminated the backtick-quoted string
early, raising a ``SyntaxError`` inside ``buildModal`` the moment
``mountKeymapOverlay`` called it.  Symptom: ``mount()`` caught the
error generally; settings drawer mounted (earlier in the flow)
but keymap overlay never materialised, and the per-cell
affordances never rebuilt.  Fix: replaced the markdown backticks
with plain ``pql.*`` text.  Caught pre-gate via a cache-busted
dynamic ``import()`` that surfaced the real
``buildModal@keymap_overlay.js:137:18`` stack trace.

**Phase 12.7 closed.**  Ten sprints (65-74) transformed the
notebook editor from the Sprint-58 single-file monolith into a
modular, multi-tab, multi-cell-type, audit-trailed surface.
Phase 13 (Agent workloads) is next on the roadmap with the
EXPLAIN-agent loop sketched as the natural Phase-12 → Phase-13
bridge.

No Alembic migration.  Trim-safe.

### Added (Sprint 73) — Phase 12.7: Per-cell run history + diff (Alembic 018)

Ninth Phase 12.7 sprint.  Adds an audit trail of every cell
execute_request — source snapshot + lifecycle status + timestamps
+ ``execution_count`` — and a per-cell history popover with
``view diff`` against current Monaco source and a ``re-run``
button that replays the historical source through the kernel
without modifying the Monaco buffer ("what did the old version
produce?" UX, not "revert to this").

**Schema (Alembic 018).** New ``notebook_cell_run_sources`` table
with autoincrement id PK; sibling to the Sprint-60
``notebook_cell_runs`` upsert (which keeps "current state per
session" and would otherwise clobber the prior run on every
re-execute).  No FK to ``notebook_cell_runs`` — link is logical
via the indexed columns; cascade lives in
``notebook_outputs.py`` service (Sprint-67 cascade-via-service
pattern) on file delete + rename only.  ``clear_cell`` and
``clear_session`` deliberately do NOT touch the history table —
the audit trail explicitly survives both per-cell clear-outputs
and kernel restarts.

- [pointlessql/alembic/versions/018_notebook_cell_run_sources.py](pointlessql/alembic/versions/018_notebook_cell_run_sources.py)
  — new migration; ``ix_notebook_cell_run_sources_path_cell`` on
  ``(file_path, cell_id, started_at)``.
- [pointlessql/models.py](pointlessql/models.py) — new
  ``NotebookCellRunSource`` ORM model.
- [pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py](pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py)
  — ``record_cell_run_start`` (insert + return id),
  ``record_cell_run_finish`` (stamp by id),
  ``list_cell_run_sources`` (newest-first JSON-ready dicts).
- [pointlessql/api/main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py)
  — ``pending_run_sources`` map keyed by ``(cell_id,
  kernel_session_id)``; ``_wipe_cell_for_new_execute`` calls
  ``record_cell_run_start`` and stashes the returned id;
  ``_handle_shell_lifecycle`` pops the id on ``execute_reply`` and
  calls ``record_cell_run_finish``.  New admin-gated
  ``GET /api/notebook/cell-runs?path=…&cell_id=…&limit=…``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/run_history.js](frontend/js/notebook/run_history.js)
  — new module.  Closure-scoped popover + cache + AbortController.
  Re-run sends the historical source via the existing ``execute``
  WS frame (NOT ``execute_sql``, since SQL history rows already
  hold the wrapped ``__pql_sql_run(...)`` snippet — re-running
  executes the same SQL without re-walking the route's privilege
  check).  Does NOT touch Monaco.
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js)
  — clock-icon ``.pql-nbedit-history-btn`` mounted on every
  ``canExecute`` cell; ``handlers.onShowHistory(cellId, anchorEl)``
  threaded through ``mountAffordances``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — ``openHistoryPopover(cellId, anchorEl)`` reads current source
  via ``cellSourceById`` for diffing.
- [scripts/vendor-diff-lib.sh](scripts/vendor-diff-lib.sh)
  — new vendoring script for jsdiff 5.2.0 (npm ``diff``, MIT,
  ~10 KB UMD ``window.Diff``).
- [.gitignore](.gitignore) — added
  ``frontend/js/vendor/jsdiff/``.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — ``<script src="/static/js/vendor/jsdiff/diff.min.js?v=sprint73">``
  tag; bootstrap.js bumped to ``?v=sprint73``;
  ``.pql-nbedit-history-btn`` / ``.pql-nbedit-history-popover`` /
  ``.pql-nbedit-diff`` styles.
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden pattern to cover ``this._historyCache`` /
  ``this._historyPopover`` / ``this._historyAbort``.
- [docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md)
  — Playbook **Part N** added; replayed in Firefox via
  Playwright-MCP as the land gate.

**BUG-73-01 (replay-caught + fixed in same commit):** the first
version of the service threaded ``NotebookCellRunSource`` deletes
through the ``clear_cell`` cascade alongside ``NotebookOutput``
and ``NotebookCellRun``.  But ``clear_cell`` is called from
``_wipe_cell_for_new_execute`` at the top of every execute_request,
so the cascade meant every re-run deleted the prior run's row
before ``record_cell_run_start`` inserted its own — only the
most-recent run ever existed in the history table.  Fix: removed
the ``NotebookCellRunSource`` delete from ``clear_cell`` AND
``clear_session``; cascade now lives only in ``clear_path`` (file
delete) and ``rename_path`` (file rename).  Caught at the N2 step
on the first replay (DB query showed exactly one row even after
three runs).

Trim-safe — Sprint 74 (theme + keymap + phase close) does not
import the run-history module; revert is sprint-local.

### Added (Sprint 72) — Phase 12.7: ipywidgets minimal placeholder

Eighth Phase 12.7 sprint.  Scope deliberately trimmed to a
placeholder layer; full bidirectional ``comm_msg`` round-trip +
vendored widget-manager bundle deferred to a future sprint per the
Phase-12.7 master-plan decision.  ``import ipywidgets as w`` now
works in the kernel, and the output renderer paints a styled
placeholder card whenever a ``display_data`` /
``execute_result`` carries
``application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json`` — the user sees
where the slider / dropdown WOULD live once a future sprint wires
the widget-manager.

- [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) — added ``ipywidgets>=8.1`` to
  the dependency list; ``uv lock`` resolved
  ``ipywidgets-8.1.8`` + ``jupyterlab-widgets-3.0.16`` +
  ``widgetsnbextension-4.0.15``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/output_renderer.js](frontend/js/notebook/output_renderer.js)
  — new high-priority MIME branch in ``renderMimeBundle``.  Must
  come BEFORE ``text/html`` so the widget bundle wins over the
  fallback ``text/plain`` repr (every ipywidgets ``execute_result``
  carries both).  Renders a ``.pql-nbedit-output-widget-placeholder``
  card with truncated ``model_id`` + disclaimer.  Missing
  ``model_id`` falls back to ``Widget output (unrenderable)``.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — ``renderKernelMsg`` silently swallows ``comm_open`` /
  ``comm_msg`` / ``comm_close``.  No console log: a single
  ``IntSlider()`` instantiation emits dozens of comm frames and
  logging would flood DevTools.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — ``.pql-nbedit-output-widget-placeholder`` +
  ``.pql-nbedit-widget-model-id`` + ``.pql-nbedit-widget-note``
  styles; bootstrap.js script tag bumped to ``?v=sprint72``.
- [docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md)
  — Playbook **Part M** added with synthetic + real-widget +
  comm-swallow + missing-``model_id`` + persist/replay steps.
  Renderer verified end-to-end via a cache-busted
  ``import('/static/js/notebook/output_renderer.js?_t=' + Date.now())``
  because of BUG-72-01 below.

**BUG-72-01 — ES module disk cache hides new mime branches.**  The
notebook editor's [bootstrap.js](frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js)
carries a ``?v=sprintNN`` query param so its own ``<script>``
invalidates, but the modules it dynamically imports
(``editor_shell.js`` + ``main.js`` + the eight siblings,
including ``output_renderer.js``) do not carry a version param, so
the browser keeps the previous deploy's modules in disk cache.
Workaround for this sprint: bumped bootstrap.js to ``?v=sprint72``
and documented the hard-reload requirement (``Ctrl+Shift+R``) in
Part M.  Permanent fix is a follow-on sprint that threads a build-
time version stamp into every dynamic import URL — out of scope
here.

No Alembic migration.  Trim-safe — the placeholder branch is the
upgrade seam a future sprint will replace with a real widget-
manager.  No closure state added, so the reactivity-boundary grep
gate is unchanged.

### Added (Sprint 71) — Phase 12.7: SQL cell (DuckDB via PQL.sql)

Seventh Phase 12.7 sprint.  Adds the first non-Python cell type and
validates Sprint 66's cell-type registry as the right seam for new
languages.  Marker grammar widens to
``# %% [sql] pql_cell_id="<uuid>" result_var="<ident>"``; the
``result_var`` segment is optional (Databricks-style — picked over
the originally-sketched ``_pql_sql_<short-uuid>`` auto-generator
to keep chained-cell readability).  ``runCellById`` branches on the
new ``sql`` descriptor and emits an ``execute_sql`` WS frame; the
route handler parses + privilege-checks every 3-part reference
against soyuz-catalog (mirrors ``/api/sql/execute``'s SELECT loop
via the new shared ``_resolve_sql_approved_tables`` helper) before
wrapping the source into a ``__pql_sql_run(...)`` snippet that runs
in the kernel.  The kernel-side helper, defined once at start time
via ``_NOTEBOOK_BOOTSTRAP_CODE`` (silent execute_request awaited
before the iopub / shell pump tasks start so SQL runs cannot race
the helper definition), calls ``PQL.sql`` for real, materialises
the result as a pandas DataFrame, optionally binds it to the user-
named ``result_var`` in ``globals()`` for Variable Explorer to
surface, and ``display(df)`` so the Sprint-60 rich-mime path
renders the table inline.  Restart re-queues the bootstrap via the
existing execute path under reserved cell_id
``__pql_sql_bootstrap__`` so ``_is_internal_cell`` skips
persistence.

- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js)
  — registered ``sql`` descriptor (``markerTag: ' [sql]'``,
  ``canExecute: true``, ``bandClass: 'pql-nbedit-cell-band-sql'``,
  ``affordances: ['result_var']``).
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_parser.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_parser.js)
  — widened ``CELL_MARKER_RE`` to capture optional
  ``result_var="<ident>"`` (group 3); ``splitCells`` /
  ``joinCells`` round-trip the field; ``RESULT_VAR_RE`` exported
  for the affordance validator.
- [frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js)
  — per-cell ``result_var`` text input (300 ms debounce write-back,
  CSS error class on invalid identifiers); ``+ SQL`` inserter
  button alongside ``+ Code`` / ``+ Markdown``;
  ``removeAffordances`` clears the debounce on cell teardown.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — ``runCellById`` branches on ``typeId === 'sql'`` and emits
  ``execute_sql``; ``runAllCells`` / ``runCellsAbove`` share the
  new ``sendCellFrame`` helper; ``cellResultVarById`` reads the
  marker; ``applyResultVarToMarker`` writes back via
  ``editor.executeEdits`` so on-disk text stays the source of
  truth.
- [pointlessql/api/main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py)
  — new ``execute_sql`` WS branch; shared
  ``_resolve_sql_approved_tables`` helper that returns either
  ``(approved, None)`` or ``({}, error_dict)`` so the WS handler
  can ship a synthetic kernel_msg straight to the cell's output
  zone on parse / catalog / privilege failures; refactored
  ``_wipe_cell_for_new_execute`` to share the persistence prelude
  with the existing ``execute`` branch.
- [pointlessql/services/kernel_session.py](pointlessql/services/kernel_session.py)
  — ``_NOTEBOOK_BOOTSTRAP_CODE`` defines ``__pql_sql_run`` in the
  kernel; ``_run_bootstrap`` runs it silently with a
  ``_BOOTSTRAP_TIMEOUT`` safety net; ``restart`` re-queues the
  bootstrap via the regular execute path under reserved cell_id
  ``__pql_sql_bootstrap__``.
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — ``.pql-nbedit-cell-band-sql`` band hue + ``.pql-nbedit-result-var``
  input styling.
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden pattern to cover ``this._resultVarTimers``
  / ``this._sqlBootstrap``.
- [docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md)
  — Playbook **Part L** added; replayed in Firefox via
  Playwright-MCP as the land gate per
  ``feedback_run_playbook_as_gate``.  Replay caught BUG-71-01:
  pandas's ``DataFrame.__repr__`` raised ``TypeError`` because
  ``SQLResult.columns`` is ``list[dict[str, str]]``, not bare
  names; fix in the same commit extracts the names with
  ``[c.get("name") if isinstance(c, dict) else c for c in
  res.columns]`` before constructing the DataFrame.

No Alembic migration.  Trim-safe — Sprints 72-74 do not import the
SQL cell.

### Added (Sprint 70) — Phase 12.7: Outline / TOC panel + cell jump

Sixth Phase 12.7 sprint.  Adds a right-side Outline panel that peers
with the Variable Explorer (mutually exclusive, same 320px slot,
same chrome).  Lists markdown H1/H2/H3 ATX headings (indented per
level) and each code cell's first non-blank stripped line
(truncated to ~60 chars).  Clicking a row jumps Monaco to the
cell's first content line and scrolls it to the viewport centre
via ``editor.revealLineInCenter`` + ``editor.focus``.

- **New module** [frontend/js/notebook/outline.js](frontend/js/notebook/outline.js)
  — pure ``buildOutline(cells)`` regex helper + ``stripCodeLabel``.
  No markdown-it dependency (dodges the Sprint-69 UMD/AMD
  loader-order class, BUG-69-01).  No closure state — re-entrant,
  idempotent.
- [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js)
  — closure-scoped ``outlineEntries`` + 150ms debounce timer;
  mirrored into reactive ``this.outline`` as a fresh array on
  every change so Alpine's x-for diffs once per real edit.
  ``toggleOutline()`` mutually excludes with ``toggleVariables()``.
  ``jumpToCell(cellId)`` reuses ``findCellMarkerLine`` verbatim
  and adds ``revealLineInCenter`` + ``focus``.  Recompute
  re-splits from the live Monaco model
  (``splitCells(model.getValue())``) rather than reading the
  closure-scoped ``cells`` array — ``cells`` is only refreshed on
  save / ``rescanDecorations``, so free-form typing inside a cell
  would have left the outline stale (BUG-70-01, replay-caught).
- [frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)
  — ``Outline`` toolbar button between Variables and Run cell;
  right-side ``<aside class="pql-nbedit-outline">`` mirroring the
  Variables aside; inline CSS for per-level indent classes
  (``.pql-outline-l1`` / ``-l2`` / ``-l3`` / ``-code``).
- [scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh)
  — widened forbidden list to cover ``this._outlineEntries``,
  ``this._outlineTimer``, ``this._outlineDebounce`` so a future
  change cannot regress by parking the 150ms debounce handle on
  Alpine's proxy (its captured closure holds the live ``cells``
  array; Alpine's reactive walk would recurse — exactly the
  BUG-64-02 shape).
- [docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md)
  — Part K replay added with 7 numbered steps + known-quirks
  section + bug-catch write-ups for BUG-70-01 (stale closure
  ``cells``) and BUG-70-02 (over-stripping jupytext prefix
  double-shifted heading levels).

**No Alembic migration.**  Pure frontend, no backend change, no
persisted state (open/closed panel is session-only).  Trim-safe
per the Phase 12.7 roadmap — nothing downstream depends on
``outline.js`` or ``this.outline``; revert is O(1) sprint-local.

### Added (Sprint 69) — Phase 12.7: markdown-it + KaTeX + pencil pin

Fifth Phase 12.7 sprint.  Replaces the Sprint-65 regex markdown
preview renderer with ``markdown-it`` (CommonMark-conformant —
tables, nested lists, task lists, autolinking), layers KaTeX for
``$…$`` / ``$$…$$`` math via ``markdown-it-texmath``, and adds a
per-cell pencil button that pins a markdown cell into source view
independently of cursor position.

- **Vendored bundles** ([scripts/vendor-markdown-libs.sh](scripts/vendor-markdown-libs.sh)
  — new).  Fetches markdown-it 14.1.0, markdown-it-texmath 1.0.0,
  and KaTeX 0.16.11 from the npm registry into gitignored dirs
  under ``frontend/js/vendor/``.  Mirrors the Monaco vendoring
  pattern from ADR 0001.  Appends a ``window.texmath = texmath``
  line to the vendored ``texmath.js`` because the package ships
  CommonJS-only.
- **Renderer swap** ([frontend/js/notebook/markdown.js](frontend/js/notebook/markdown.js)).
  Exported signature unchanged — ``renderMarkdown(src) → string`` —
  so the single call site in ``main.js`` stays untouched.  Cached
  markdown-it instance lives in a module-scoped ``let`` (closure,
  not Alpine proxy); KaTeX registration is a single ``.use(...)``
  line, layer-droppable without touching the rest of the module.
- **Pencil-pin affordance** ([frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js),
  [frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js),
  [frontend/js/notebook/main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js)).
  Markdown descriptor gains ``affordances: ['pin']``; the toolbar
  renders a ``bi-pencil`` button right of the cell-type label on
  cells whose descriptor opts in.  Click toggles
  ``markdownZones[cellId].editModePinned`` (closure-scoped,
  session-only — no marker grammar changes, no ADR 0001 churn);
  pinned cells stay unhidden by ``updateHiddenAreas`` regardless
  of cursor position.  A rebuild re-syncs the pencil state so a
  content edit does not desync the icon.
- **Template wiring** ([frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)).
  KaTeX CSS link added; three UMD script tags (markdown-it,
  katex, texmath) load **before** ``monaco/vs/loader.js`` so
  their UMD wrappers fall through to the plain-script branch
  (BUG-69-01 replay-caught).  New CSS rules for the pencil
  button + markdown-it tables / nested lists / blockquotes /
  KaTeX blocks.  ``bootstrap.js`` cache bust bumped to
  ``?v=sprint69``.
- **Reactivity-boundary gate widened** ([scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh))
  to block ``this._mdSingleton`` / ``this._mdPinState`` /
  ``this._pinHandlers``.  markdown-it's rule registries are
  exactly the kind of deep-circular object that Alpine's
  reactive walk would wrap and traverse on every re-render —
  same BUG-64-02 class of bug, pre-empted.
- **Playbook Part J** ([docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md))
  — ten-step walkthrough (CommonMark table, nested lists, inline
  KaTeX, block KaTeX, pin keeps source visible, unpin collapses,
  session-only reset, code cells have no pencil, KaTeX drop-
  sanity, earlier-sprint regression pass).

### Fixed (Sprint 69 replay catch)

- **BUG-69-01 — UMD vs AMD loader-order collision.**  The first
  Part-J replay loaded ``markdown-it.min.js`` and ``katex.min.js``
  after ``monaco/vs/loader.js``.  Both scripts ship UMD wrappers
  that detect Monaco's ``window.define`` and register as anonymous
  AMD modules, colliding with Monaco's "one anonymous define per
  script file" contract.  Fixed by loading the three markdown
  vendor scripts **before** Monaco's loader, so ``window.define``
  does not yet exist when their UMD wrappers execute and they
  bind to ``window.markdownit`` / ``window.katex`` as globals.
  The template now documents the ordering rationale inline.

### Added (Sprint 68) — Phase 12.7: multi-notebook tab bar

Fourth Phase 12.7 sprint.  Adds a tab bar above the editor so the
user can keep several notebooks open in one page and switch
between them without a reload.  Each tab hosts its own Monaco
editor + kernel WS + LSP WS; the Sprint-65 closure-ref factory is
already N-instance-safe and the Sprint-66 affordance machinery is
editor-scoped, so tab switches are a CSS ``display`` flip rather
than a Monaco teardown.

- **Tab bar** ([frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html)).
  New ``.pql-nbedit-tabbar`` above the layout; each tab shows the
  file basename, a dirty dot (``•``) when the buffer is unsaved,
  and a close button.  Horizontal-scroll overflow; no dropdown
  overflow menu.  Soft-cap at 10 tabs — the eleventh open toasts
  ``Tab limit reached``.  The Files-sidebar toggle moved from the
  per-tab toolbar to the tab-bar's right side (the sidebar is
  shell-scoped, not tab-scoped).
- **Editor shell factory** ([frontend/js/notebook/editor_shell.js](frontend/js/notebook/editor_shell.js)
  — new module).  Alpine factory ``createNotebookEditorShell``
  owns tabs + activeTabId + the close-confirm modal + the file-
  tree sidebar slice + localStorage persistence (``pql.nbedit.
  tabs.v1``).  Listens on ``document`` for ``pql:open-tab`` /
  ``pql:file-renamed`` / ``pql:file-deleted`` /
  ``pql:tab-state-changed`` — the sidebar and the per-tab scopes
  talk to the shell through this bus rather than via cross-scope
  reference walking.
- **Per-tab factory split** ([frontend/js/notebook/main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js)).
  Renamed ``createNotebookEditor`` → ``createNotebookTabEditor``;
  added optional ``tabId`` / ``initial`` / ``bundleLoader`` args.
  Cell + output initialisation moved inside ``mount()`` so lazy
  tabs defer network + Monaco work until first activation.  The
  factory dispatches ``pql:tab-state-changed`` for ``mounted`` /
  ``dirty`` / ``saveState`` transitions so the tab chrome stays
  in sync without reaching into the child proxy.
- **GET /api/notebook/doc** ([pointlessql/api/main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py)).
  The only backend change — a small read-only endpoint returning
  the same ``{cells, dirty, outputs}`` bundle the HTML editor
  route embeds.  Shared helper ``_build_notebook_doc_bundle``
  wraps ``notebook_doc_service.load_document`` +
  ``notebook_outputs_service.load_outputs_for_path``; the HTML
  route and the new JSON route call it identically, so first-
  paint and lazy-load can never drift.  (Roadmap line originally
  said "No backend changes"; amended with this deviation note.)
- **Sidebar API reshape** ([frontend/js/notebook/file_tree.js](frontend/js/notebook/file_tree.js)).
  ``createFileTreeSlice`` now takes ``getActivePath`` +
  ``isPathOpenInAnyTab`` callbacks instead of a static
  ``currentPath``.  Row-click / create / rename / delete dispatch
  CustomEvents on ``document`` instead of calling
  ``window.location.assign`` — the shell orchestrates tab state.
  Trash-disable now covers *any* open tab, not just the active
  one.
- **Reactivity-boundary gate widened** ([scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh))
  to block ``this._tabRefs`` and ``this._tabFactories``.  A
  shell that aggregates per-tab closure bags onto its Alpine-
  reactive ``this._`` would reproduce BUG-64-02 at N× scale.
- **Close-tab-with-unsaved-changes modal**.  Bootstrap dialog
  with Cancel / Discard & close / Save & close; reuses the
  Sprint-67 ``:class="{'d-block': flag}"`` pattern (BUG-67-01).
  Save & close dispatches ``pql:save-tab`` and waits for the
  child factory's next ``saveState`` emission before closing;
  if the save errors, the modal stays open and surfaces via the
  per-tab save toast.
- **Playbook Part I** ([docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md))
  — eleven-step multi-tab walkthrough (first open, row-click
  opens second tab lazily, cross-tab state preservation, dirty
  dot, close-clean / close-dirty / confirm-modal, reload
  persistence + lazy hydration, kernel sharing, rename updates
  chrome in place, delete closes tab silently, ten-tab cap
  toast).

### Fixed (Sprint 68 replay catch)

- **Tab-mounted flag lost during stub→real scope swap.**  The
  bootstrap stub seeded ``tabs = [seedTab]`` synchronously with
  ``mounted: false``; the template's ``x-init="tab.mounted = true;
  mount()"`` set the flag on the seed, but the async import of
  ``editor_shell.js`` + ``_hydrateTabs()`` replaced the tabs array
  wholesale — the flag was dropped on the floor.  Alpine's
  ``:key="tab.id"`` diff reused the DOM element so x-init did not
  re-fire, leaving ``tab.mounted: false`` on the live tab.  Net
  effect: opening a second tab made the first tab's ``x-if``
  (``tab.mounted || active``) evaluate false, Alpine unmounted
  the pane, Monaco + kernel were torn down mid-session.  Fixed
  by having the per-tab factory fire
  ``pql:tab-state-changed { mounted: true }`` **synchronously**
  at the top of ``mount()``, before any async Monaco / kernel /
  LSP work; the shell's listener updates ``tab.mounted`` in the
  tabs array so the x-if lazy-mount wrapper stays true through
  subsequent tab switches.

### Added (Sprint 67) — Phase 12.7: file-tree sidebar inside the editor

Third Phase 12.7 sprint.  Mounts the Sprint-27 workspace tree as a
slim left sidebar in ``/notebook/editor`` and closes the long-
deferred notebook create / rename / delete actions from Sprint 27.
The full-screen ``/notebooks/workspace`` page stays as-is.

- **File-tree sidebar** ([frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html](frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html),
  [frontend/js/notebook/file_tree.js](frontend/js/notebook/file_tree.js)).
  260px left panel listing directories + ``.py`` + ``.ipynb`` leaves
  from ``/api/notebooks/tree``.  Hover pencil / trash; click names
  to navigate.  Currently-open row is highlighted and its trash is
  disabled to keep the editor out of a dangling state after delete.
  Toggle state persists in ``localStorage['pql.nbedit.filesVisible']``;
  sidebar defaults visible on first load.
- **Three CRUD endpoints** ([pointlessql/api/main.py](pointlessql/api/main.py)):
  ``POST /api/notebooks/create`` writes a zero-byte ``.py`` file
  (the editor's open handler already materialises cell markers on
  first save), ``PATCH /api/notebooks/rename`` atomically moves a
  file and re-keys its replay cache, ``DELETE /api/notebooks?path=…``
  removes the file and cascades into ``notebook_outputs`` +
  ``notebook_cell_runs``.  All admin-only, all audit-logged.
- **Shared resolver** ([pointlessql/services/notebook_workspace.py](pointlessql/services/notebook_workspace.py)):
  new ``resolve_notebook_target`` owns the traversal + parent-
  directory guard for every mutation helper; the pre-existing
  ``resolve_upload_target`` now delegates to it.  Added
  ``create_empty_notebook`` / ``rename_notebook`` /
  ``delete_notebook`` helpers.
- **Replay cache re-keying** ([pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py](pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py)):
  new ``rename_path`` ``UPDATE``s ``file_path`` on ``NotebookOutput``
  + ``NotebookCellRun`` so rename preserves per-cell outputs + run
  history.  Paired with the existing ``clear_path`` which is now
  wired from the delete endpoint.
- **Three Bootstrap modals** on the editor page — new / rename /
  delete — reusing the Catalog-Insert modal's ``x-show`` +
  ``@keydown.escape.window`` pattern.
- **Reactivity-boundary gate widened** ([scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh](scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh))
  to block ``this._treeFetchCtrl`` and ``this._treeAbort`` —
  sidebar's AbortController for inflight tree fetches stays in
  closure scope.
- **Playbook Part H** ([docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md))
  covers the six sidebar flows: render, toggle, open, new,
  rename-open-file (hard-reload), delete-other-file (tree refresh).

### Fixed (Sprint 67 replay catch)

- **BUG-67-01** — Alpine 3.14.1's ``x-show`` sets inline
  ``display = ''`` on ``false → true``, letting Bootstrap 5's
  ``.modal { display: none }`` CSS rule win: every editor modal
  stayed invisible on its first open even though Alpine thought
  it was visible.  The pre-existing Catalog-Insert modal (Sprint
  62-ish) had the same latent bug.  Fixed by replacing ``x-show``
  with ``:class="{ 'd-block': flag }"`` on all four editor modals
  (Catalog, New, Rename, Delete) — Bootstrap's ``.d-block``
  utility is ``display: block !important`` which beats both the
  cascade and Alpine's inline manipulation.  Caught by replaying
  Part H of the editor playbook in Firefox per
  ``feedback_run_playbook_as_gate``.

**No Alembic migration** — rename is a plain ``UPDATE``, delete
reuses the ``clear_path`` stub Sprint 63 had already wired in
anticipation of this sprint.

### Added (Sprint 66) — Phase 12.7: cell-type registry + per-cell affordances

Second Phase 12.7 sprint.  Converts the hardcoded ``code | markdown``
fork spread across ``cell_parser.js`` + ``main.js`` into a single
descriptor registry, and surfaces per-cell affordances (run button,
execution-count pill, elapsed-time pill, status pill, ``+`` inserter)
that the wire protocol already carried but the Sprint-58 UI ignored.
No backend changes, no Alembic migration — the ``notebook_cell_runs``
columns reserved by Sprint 60's Alembic 017 stay unwritten until
Sprint 73 actually persists per-cell history.

- **Cell-type registry** at [frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_types.js).
  One descriptor per type with ``id``, ``label``, ``markerTag``,
  ``canExecute``, ``bandClass``.  ``getCellType(id)`` is the single
  lookup point; unknown tags fall back to ``code`` so a Sprint-71
  ``[sql]`` marker loaded by a pre-Sprint-71 client renders as plain
  Python instead of dropping the cell.  ``CELL_MARKER_RE`` widened
  from ``(\s+\[markdown\])?`` to ``(\s+\[\w+\])?``.
- **Per-cell affordances** at [frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js](frontend/js/notebook/cell_affordances.js).
  Two view zones per cell — a 26px toolbar above the marker (run
  button + ``[n]`` exec count + status pill + elapsed + type label)
  and a 22px hover-revealed inserter below the cell body with
  ``+ Code`` / ``+ Markdown`` buttons.  All DOM nodes, Monaco view-
  zone handles, and ``setInterval`` timers live in a closure-scoped
  ``cellAffordances`` map on the orchestrator — BUG-64-02
  reactivity-boundary invariant preserved.
- **WS wiring.**  ``renderKernelMsg`` in ``main.js`` now intercepts
  ``execute_input`` (pulls ``execution_count`` into the pill) and
  ``execute_reply`` (maps ``ok`` / ``error`` / ``aborted`` →
  ``ok`` / ``error`` / ``cancelled``) before dispatching to the
  existing ``appendOutputFrame`` path, so empty output zones no
  longer leak from shell-channel replies.
- **Status pills.**  Five states — ``idle``, ``running`` (yellow,
  pulsing), ``ok`` (green), ``error`` (red), ``cancelled``
  (muted).  Elapsed timer ticks every 100 ms during a run and
  freezes on ``execute_reply``.  Kernel ``restart`` resets all
  count pills to ``[ ]``, status pills to ``idle``, and clears
  elapsed.
- **Single execution seam.**  ``runCellById(cellId)`` is the one
  method that fires an execute frame; ``runCurrentCell`` /
  ``runAllCells`` / ``runCellsAbove`` / per-cell ``▶`` button all
  route through it.  Registry's ``canExecute`` gate is checked once
  at the seam instead of being duplicated per-call-site.
- **``+`` inserter**.  Inserts a fresh cell (with UUID from
  ``crypto.randomUUID``) one line below the anchor cell's body,
  using ``getCellType(typeId).markerTag`` so the inserter does not
  know about the specific tag strings.  ``rebuildCellAffordances``
  is idempotent — it re-runs on every ``onDidChangeContent`` and
  moves zones via ``removeZone`` + ``addZone`` to re-anchor after
  boundary shifts.
- **Reactivity-boundary gate widened.**  ``scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh``
  now also blocks ``this._cellAffordances``, ``this._statusWidgets``,
  ``this._cellWidgets``, and ``this._reactiveRoot`` so the
  Sprint-66 state surface cannot be smuggled back onto ``this._X``
  under a different field name.
- **Playbook Part G** added to [docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md)
  covering the seven check-boxes: toolbar visible per cell, per-cell
  run button, error status, interrupt → cancelled, ``+`` inserter
  (code + markdown), kernel-restart reset, page-reload BUG-64-02
  regression gate.  Replayed in Firefox via Playwright-MCP as the
  land gate per ``feedback_run_playbook_as_gate``.
- **Alpine-vs-ESM race fix** (caught by the replay).  Sprint-65's
  ``<script type="module" src="bootstrap.js">`` + the two extra
  Sprint-66 modules pushed the ESM graph resolution past Alpine's
  deferred boot, leaving the reactive scope empty on first load.
  Fixed by converting [bootstrap.js](frontend/js/notebook/bootstrap.js)
  from a module to a classic IIFE that registers
  ``window.notebookEditor`` synchronously during HTML parse and
  dynamic-imports [main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js) inside
  the factory's ``mount()``.  Same mitigation pattern as the
  Sprint-41 SQL-editor fix (commit ``b830300``).  Script tag
  carries ``?v=sprint66`` to bust Firefox's module cache for
  consumers upgrading in-place.
- **KeyboardInterrupt → ``cancelled``** (caught by the replay).
  Jupyter surfaces a user-interrupted cell as
  ``execute_reply.status='error'`` with ``ename='KeyboardInterrupt'``,
  not ``status='aborted'``.  The reply handler in
  [main.js](frontend/js/notebook/main.js) now maps both
  ``aborted`` and ``error + ename='KeyboardInterrupt'`` to the
  ``cancelled`` pill so the red error state is reserved for
  genuine runtime errors.

### Added (Sprint 65) — Phase 12.7 opener: editor JS modularisation

Phase 12.7 ("Notebook editor UX overhaul") opens with a structural
sprint that prepares the notebook editor codebase for the eight UX-
heavy follow-on sprints (cell-type registry, file-tree sidebar,
multi-tab, markdown-it + KaTeX, outline, SQL cell, ipywidgets,
history + diff, theme + keymap).  No visible UX change — the
existing 22-step playbook still passes unchanged; visible-UX sprints
starting with Sprint 66 will replay the playbook before commit.

- **JS module split.**  ``frontend/js/notebook_editor.js`` (1571-LoC
  IIFE) is replaced by nine ESM modules under
  ``frontend/js/notebook/``: ``cell_parser.js`` (markers + namespace
  introspect snippet), ``ansi.js`` (SGR → HTML traceback rendering),
  ``markdown.js`` (regex preview renderer; Sprint 69 will swap for
  ``markdown-it``), ``monaco_loader.js`` (vendored AMD + the Sprint-
  64 defer-until-load wrapper), ``pyright_client.js`` (JSON-RPC
  client + Monaco completion / hover / signature / definition
  provider registration via ``WeakMap``), ``output_renderer.js``
  (mime-bundle dispatch + Sprint-62 inline-script rehydration),
  ``closure_state.js`` (``createClosureRefs`` helper — see below),
  ``main.js`` (Alpine-factory orchestrator), and ``bootstrap.js``
  (ESM entry that exposes ``window.notebookEditor`` so Alpine's
  ``x-data="notebookEditor(...)"`` keeps resolving).
- **``createClosureRefs`` helper.**  Promotes the Sprint-64
  BUG-64-02 fix from inline-comment mahnung to a documented sealed
  bag of mutable refs that never leaves the factory closure.  Monaco
  model + editor refs live in ``refs`` (named slots; typo throws);
  other private state (timers, WebSocket handles, output-zone DOM
  maps, accumulator buffers, parsed-cell cache) moved to closure-
  scoped ``let`` vars.  The reactive object Alpine sees now carries
  primitive UI state + bound methods only.
- **CI grep gate.**  ``scripts/check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh``
  greps ``frontend/js/notebook/`` for the forbidden assignment
  pattern ``this\._(editor|model|monaco|worker|wsRaw|lspWsRaw|
  saveTimer)\s*=`` and exits non-zero on a hit.  Wired into
  ``.github/workflows/test.yml`` after the ``alembic check`` step
  — pure shell, no Python venv needed.  Belt-and-suspenders against
  Sprint-66+ accidentally re-introducing the BUG-64-02 class of
  bug under a different field name.
- **Template** (``frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html``)
  now loads ``<script type="module"
  src=".../notebook/bootstrap.js">``; the legacy
  ``notebook_editor.js`` is **deleted** (no grace alias — the sole
  consumer was edited in the same commit).  Two ``x-show``
  expressions that referenced the now-closure-scoped
  ``_catalogTables`` switched to the new ``catalogTablesLoaded``
  flag and ``catalogTablesEmpty`` getter on the reactive object.
- **ROADMAP.md** opens Phase 12.7 with the ten-sprint tree (65–74)
  and five trim-points marked.  Hard dependency chain: 65 unblocks
  all later sprints, 66 unblocks 71, 67 → 68.  Max-trim path is
  ``65 → 66 → 68 → 73 → 74``.

All gates green: ruff, pyright, pydoclint, alembic upgrade head +
check, plus the new ``check-frontend-no-reactive-monaco.sh``.

### Added (Sprint 64) — Phase 12.6 close: editor E2E playbook

Phase 12.6 closes with its e2e playbook and the one-release
grace aliases from Sprint 63 removed.

- **``docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-editor.md``** — six-part
  deterministic playbook (First open / Execute+persistence /
  Pyright LSP / Insert-from-catalog / Variable Explorer /
  Post-retirement surfaces) replacing the Sprint-23 JupyterLab
  iframe playbook.  Same step-by-step shape the other
  playbooks follow so a human with a browser or an MCP-driven
  Claude Code session can replay it deterministically.
- **Grace aliases removed.**  ``GET /notebook`` no longer
  302-redirects (the route is unregistered; the navbar link
  goes straight to the editor so no internal caller relied on
  the redirect).  ``open-in-notebook`` response dropped the
  ``lab_url`` alias; ``pages/table.html`` reads
  ``editor_url`` directly.
- **Sprint-23 ``notebook.md`` playbook retired** — obsoleted
  by the iframe retirement.  The walkthroughs README index
  points at ``notebook-editor.md`` as slot #7.

**Phase 12.6 → ✅**.  The native notebook editor started as a
Sprint-58 skeleton (Monaco + jupytext round-trip), layered
execution (59) + persisted rich outputs (60) + Pyright LSP (61)
+ Variable Explorer / catalog insert (62) + papermill ``.py``
bridge + iframe retirement (63), and closed with the playbook
here in Sprint 64.  The quality bar ("as good as VSCode Python
Interactive Window") landed unchanged from the plan.

### Changed — Breaking (Sprint 63) — JupyterLab iframe retired

Phase 12.6 Sprint 63 retires the Sprint-3 embedded JupyterLab
iframe.  The native Monaco editor that Sprints 58–62 built ships
every notebook-facing use case end-to-end; the iframe came out in
this commit.

Breaking changes to a running deployment:

- **``jupyterlab`` is no longer a runtime dep.**  ``pyproject.toml``
  drops ``jupyterlab>=4.0``.  ``uv sync`` removes ~30 transitive
  packages from the venv.  Docker images shrink accordingly.
- **No more JupyterLab subprocess.**  ``services/jupyter.py`` is
  gone.  The FastAPI lifespan no longer starts a kernel server
  on port 8888.  ``POINTLESSQL_JUPYTER_PORT`` stays on the
  settings class for backward-compat but does nothing.
- **``GET /notebook`` now 302-redirects** to
  ``/notebook/editor?path=scratch.py``.  The Sprint-3 iframe page
  template (``pages/notebook.html``) is deleted.
- **``GET /api/jupyter/status`` is removed.**  The endpoint was
  only used by the Sprint-3 loader polling the JupyterLab
  subprocess — the native editor has no equivalent gate.
- **User-authored ``.ipynb`` editing is unsupported.**  The
  editor reads / writes ``.py`` only.  Papermill-generated
  ``.ipynb`` under ``notebooks/runs/`` still works (execute-only
  artefact) and the Sprint-27 workspace browser still lists
  ``.ipynb`` uploads for scheduling.  Migration: run
  ``jupytext --to py:percent file.ipynb`` manually.  README
  gained a migration section.
- **Navbar simplified.**  The Sprint-58 dropdown
  (JupyterLab-classic + Editor-preview) collapsed into one
  ``Notebook`` link that goes straight to the editor.
- **Sprint-26 job-detail output card** dropped the
  ``Rendered / JupyterLab`` view-mode toggle.  The rendered
  HTML (nbconvert's lab template) is now the only mode.  The
  ``Open in JupyterLab`` anchor became a ``Download ipynb``
  button that hits the existing download endpoint.
- **``Sprint-34 open-in-notebook``** now scaffolds a ``.py``
  jupytext notebook and returns ``{editor_url: …}`` instead of
  ``{lab_url: …}``.  The ``lab_url`` alias still ships on the
  response as a one-release grace for clients that have not
  been reloaded; Sprint 64 drops it.

Positive changes enabled by the retirement:

- **Papermill can schedule ``.py`` notebooks.**  The scheduler's
  ``_papermill_executor`` gains a jupytext-convert step —
  ``.py`` inputs are converted to a sibling ``.ipynb`` in
  ``runs/``, papermill executes, and the temp ``.ipynb`` is
  unlinked in a ``finally`` block.  ``resolve_notebook_path``
  accepts both suffixes.
- **Workspace tree shows ``.py`` notebooks** with a themed icon
  and an ``Open`` button that routes into the native editor.
  ``.ipynb`` entries keep the Schedule action only.
- **CSP cleanup.**  The Sprint-3 ``frame-ancestors 'self'
  http://localhost:8000 http://127.0.0.1:8000`` header was
  scoped to the JupyterLab subprocess and went away with it.
  No separate main.py CSP entry to unwind.

All gates green: ruff, pyright (0 errors, ~87 third-party
warnings, no regressions), pydoclint.

### Added (Sprint 62) — Variable Explorer + catalog insert + rich script exec

Phase 12.6 Sprint 62 rounds out the native editor's read-side
ergonomics: a live Variable Explorer reflects the kernel's user
namespace, an ``Insert from catalog`` modal drops
``pql.read_table(...)`` snippets at the cursor, Monaco's
command palette surfaces the run / clear / restart / insert
actions, and the ``text/html`` output path now executes inline
scripts so plotly / altair / bokeh render for real.

- **``__pql_`` internal cell-id namespace.**  The WS handler's
  persistence hooks skip any cell_id starting with ``__pql_``
  on both ``notebook_outputs`` inserts and
  ``notebook_cell_runs`` upserts.  This lets the editor run
  silent introspects (Variable Explorer, future autocomplete
  helpers) under reserved cell ids without polluting the DB —
  a non-breaking-change hook Sprint 63's workspace-tree
  integration can also lean on.
- **Variable Explorer sidebar.**  Toggleable right-side panel
  that lists every user-defined variable by name + type + shape
  + a 5-row ``DataFrame`` preview (pandas-styled HTML) or a
  truncated ``repr()`` fallback.  The introspect snippet runs
  under ``__pql_namespace__`` and re-fires after every user
  cell goes idle, but only when the panel is open so inactive
  tabs pay zero introspect cost.  Smoke-tested end-to-end
  against a real ipykernel: a 2×2 pandas DataFrame round-trips
  as ``{type: "DataFrame", shape: [2, 2], repr: "…"}``.
- **Insert from catalog** modal.  Fetches ``/api/tree``,
  flattens the catalog → schema → table hierarchy into a
  searchable list, inserts ``pql.read_table("cat.schema.tbl")``
  at the cursor on pick.  Binding: Ctrl+Shift+I or toolbar
  ``Catalog`` button or the command-palette entry.
- **Command palette actions.**  Every notebook-editor command
  is registered via ``editor.addAction`` so F1 / Ctrl+Shift+P
  lists them:  ``Run all``, ``Run all cells above cursor``,
  ``Insert cell above / below``, ``Insert markdown cell below``,
  ``Clear outputs``, ``Restart kernel``, ``Insert from
  catalog…``, ``Toggle variable explorer``.  Single-letter
  ``M`` / ``Y`` / ``DD`` shortcuts deliberately skipped — the
  editor stays always-in-edit-mode, Jupyter-classic's
  command-mode state machine is not worth the bookkeeping.
- **Plotly / altair / bokeh render inline.**  ``text/html``
  output is painted via ``innerHTML`` (which sandboxes
  ``<script>``) and then every ``<script>`` in the rendered
  subtree is cloned into a freshly-parsed node so the browser
  actually executes it.  Same trick Jupyter's nbrenderer
  uses; no additional vendoring.
- **Scope-gate honoured**.  ipywidgets + any ``comm_msg`` /
  ``display_data`` updating stays out of Phase 12.6 per the
  memory decision.  If a future cell emits a widget bundle
  the renderer will simply show the fallback ``text/plain``
  rep; widgets land in Phase 12.7.

### Added (Sprint 61) — Pyright LSP (completion / hover / diagnostics)

Phase 12.6 Sprint 61 wires ``pyright-langserver`` into the native
editor over a dedicated WebSocket.  Monaco's CompletionItem,
Hover, SignatureHelp, and Definition providers now route through
pyright; diagnostics populate the gutter via
``monaco.editor.setModelMarkers``.  Kernel-backed dual-source
completion is explicitly deferred to a follow-up per the plan's
scope-killer escape hatch — LSP-only ships a clean sprint.

- **Deps.** ``pyright>=1.1`` moves from dev-only to a runtime
  dep so the ``pyright-langserver`` binary ships on
  ``.venv/bin`` for both local dev and Docker.
- **Service layer** (``pointlessql/services/pyright_bridge.py``).
  ``PyrightSession`` spawns ``pyright-langserver --stdio`` and
  handles the LSP ``Content-Length`` framing in both directions
  via asyncio stdio.  Inbound messages dispatch to an async
  callback (subscriber errors are caught + logged so a broken
  consumer doesn't tear the reader loop down); outbound
  messages add the header before writing.  ``shutdown`` sends
  SIGTERM with a 2 s timeout, then SIGKILL.
- **WS route.** ``/ws/notebook/lsp?path=<rel>`` mirrors the
  Sprint-59 kernel WS: manual ``pql_session`` cookie auth,
  same traversal guard via ``resolve_py_notebook_path``, one
  pyright subprocess per connection so subprocess lifetime
  equals tab lifetime.  A 4404 close code fires when
  ``pyright-langserver`` is missing from ``PATH`` so the UI
  can say "Pyright unavailable" instead of reconnect-looping.
- **Frontend.** A ~40-line ``PyrightClient`` handles JSON-RPC
  request/response correlation + notification subscribers.
  Monaco provider registration is gated with a module-level
  flag + a ``WeakMap`` so the same global language id can
  serve multiple editor instances without cross-fire.
  ``initialize`` → ``initialized`` → ``textDocument/didOpen``
  on mount; full-document ``didChange`` on every
  ``onDidChangeContent`` (notebook-sized buffers, incremental
  sync is not worth the bookkeeping).
  ``textDocument/publishDiagnostics`` notifications repaint
  markers via ``monaco.editor.setModelMarkers``.
- **Toolbar**. New ``lspStatus`` pill reads "Loading Pyright…"
  / "Pyright ready" / "Pyright error" / "Pyright unavailable"
  next to the ``kernelStatus`` pill.
- **Out of scope (deferred).** Kernel ``complete_request``
  merged into Monaco's completion list as a second source —
  explicit scope-killer invocation, lands as a Sprint-61
  follow-up (or Sprint 62) as a ~30-line provider with no
  backend changes required.
- **Validation.** Pyright subprocess smoke proved initialize →
  didOpen → completion + diagnostics round-trip against a
  seeded ``json.`` buffer: real module members came back in
  the completion list, the trailing ``.`` was flagged by the
  diagnostics channel.  All gates green.

### Added (Sprint 60) — Output persistence + rich outputs

Phase 12.6 Sprint 60 closes the "reopen doesn't cost 90 seconds"
loop locked in ADR 0001 (kernel + output-schema decisions), and
upgrades the Sprint-59 text-only renderer to the full mime-bundle
matrix Jupyter clients ship with.

- **Alembic 017.** ``notebook_outputs`` +
  ``notebook_cell_runs`` with the exact DDL ADR 0001 pinned.
  No surprise column additions, no silent PK changes.
- **ORM models** (``pointlessql/models.py``). ``NotebookOutput``
  and ``NotebookCellRun`` follow the Sprint-56 ``TableStats``
  pattern — composite index keyed on ``(file_path, cell_id)`` for
  the hot read path, quadruple unique on the output-index triple
  for write safety.
- **Service layer** (``pointlessql/services/notebook_outputs.py``).
  Deliberately thin: ``append_output`` / ``load_outputs_for_path``
  / ``clear_cell`` / ``clear_session`` / ``clear_path`` /
  ``upsert_cell_run``.  Only four content-carrying msg types
  persist (``stream`` / ``execute_result`` / ``display_data`` /
  ``error``); status + execute_input stay ephemeral.
- **WS handler persistence hooks**.  Per-connection
  ``output_counters`` drive monotonic ``output_index`` values
  across a single session.  ``execute`` triggers
  ``clear_cell`` + upsert ``status=running`` before the ZMQ
  send.  Shell-channel ``execute_reply`` closes the run row
  with mapped status (ok/error/aborted) and the kernel's
  ``execution_count``.  A new client-initiated ``clear_cell``
  frame purges both the view zone and the DB row set.
  Restart now ``clear_session``'s the outgoing kernel session
  *before* the subprocess restart bumps the session id.
- **Editor route replay**. ``GET /notebook/editor`` threads every
  persisted output through the initial Alpine payload so the
  mount paints them into view zones synchronously — the WS hello
  frame arrives ``after`` the user sees their previous outputs,
  eliminating the reopen-wait.
- **Rich mime renderer** (``frontend/js/notebook_editor.js``).
  Priority list: ``text/html`` > ``image/svg+xml`` >
  ``image/png`` > ``image/jpeg`` > ``application/json`` >
  ``text/plain`` fallback.  Pandas-styled HTML tables inherit the
  catalog dark theme via scoped CSS.  Inline matplotlib (PNG),
  altair / plotly (HTML), and standard Jupyter display_data
  flows all land on this path.
- **ANSI tracebacks**.  A dependency-free SGR walker converts
  IPython's ``ultratb`` output into coloured ``<span>``s — no
  ``xterm.js`` bundle, no vendor-script work.  Covers the
  standard 30-37 / 90-97 foreground palette + bold + reset.
- **Toolbar** gained a ``Clear cell`` button.  Sprint 59's
  ``Restart`` button now wipes the outgoing kernel session's
  persisted rows in the same click so "restart + clear" stays
  one user action.
- **ipywidgets** remain out of scope per the Phase-12.6 decision
  memory — interactive widgets are deferred to Phase 12.7 if they
  prove load-bearing.

### Added (Sprint 59) — Kernel + WebSocket proxy + basic execution

Phase 12.6 Sprint 59 adds the second layer of the native notebook
story: one long-lived ``ipykernel`` subprocess per
``(user_id, notebook_path)`` pair, a FastAPI WebSocket endpoint
that proxies ZMQ shell / iopub messages as JSON frames, and the
client half that turns Shift+Enter into a round-trip execute
with text / stream / error outputs rendered under the cell via
Monaco view zones.  Output persistence and rich mime rendering
land in Sprint 60; LSP in Sprint 61.

- **Deps.** ``jupyter_client>=8.6`` + ``ipykernel>=6.29`` now
  pinned explicitly in ``pyproject.toml`` (both already arrived
  via papermill's transitive closure).
- **Service layer** (``pointlessql/services/kernel_session.py``).
  ``KernelSession`` wraps ``AsyncKernelManager`` + a single ZMQ
  reader pump per channel that fans out to N subscriber queues
  — two browser tabs of the same notebook can watch the same
  kernel without starving each other on ``get_iopub_msg``.
  ``KernelRegistry`` owns the dict keyed by ``(user_id, path)``
  and lives on ``app.state.kernel_registry``; the FastAPI
  lifespan's existing cleanup block calls ``shutdown_all`` so a
  clean app stop tears down every in-flight subprocess
  gracefully (SIGTERM + 5 s timeout, then force-kill — mirrors
  the Sprint-3 ``jupyter._shutdown`` pattern).
  ``POINTLESSQL_PRINCIPAL`` forwards via the kernel manager's
  ``env=`` kwarg rather than the Sprint-24 ``os.environ`` lock —
  kernels are long-lived, no concurrent ``setenv`` race to
  dodge.
- **WebSocket route.** ``/ws/notebook/kernel?path=<rel>``.
  WebSocket upgrades bypass the HTTP auth middleware, so the
  handler pulls the ``pql_session`` cookie directly and decodes
  the JWT via ``auth_service.get_current_user`` — same call
  chain the HTTP middleware uses, just from a WS context.
  Traversal guard reuses ``notebook_doc_service.
  resolve_py_notebook_path``.  Client frames: ``{type: "execute"
  | "interrupt" | "restart"}``; server frames: ``{type: "hello"
  | "ack" | "kernel_msg" | "interrupted" | "restarted" |
  "error"}``.
- **Frontend.** Shift+Enter / Ctrl+Enter run the cell at the
  cursor (Monaco ``addCommand`` bindings fire only when the
  editor has focus so the toolbar and Alpine inputs keep normal
  Enter semantics).  Current-cell detection walks upward from
  the cursor line for the nearest ``pql_cell_id`` marker.
  Output zones are Monaco view zones anchored below each cell's
  last line — ``pql-nbedit-output`` styling colour-codes
  stream/stdout, stderr, ``execute_result``, and ``error``;
  tracebacks strip ANSI codes until Sprint 60 lands ANSI-to-HTML.
  Toolbar gained Interrupt (sends SIGINT) and Restart (bumps
  ``kernel_session_id``, clears outputs) buttons plus a live
  ``kernelStatus`` indicator.
- **Out of scope (Sprint 60).** Rich mimes (``text/html``,
  ``image/png``, ``image/svg+xml``, pandas-HTML, matplotlib
  inline), persisted outputs, ANSI-to-HTML traceback rendering.
  The kernel message shape already matches what the Alembic-017
  ``notebook_outputs`` table will capture — Sprint 60 swaps the
  ephemeral DOM writes for queries against the persistence
  layer without touching the WS protocol.

### Added (Sprint 58) — Native notebook editor skeleton

Phase 12.6 opens with the skeleton of a first-party Monaco-based
notebook editor that will eventually replace the Sprint-3
JupyterLab iframe. Scope for Sprint 58 is deliberately narrow:
load, render, save. Execution, LSP, and persisted outputs land in
Sprints 59–60.

- **ADR 0001** — ``docs/adr/0001-notebook-editor.md`` locks in
  the three decisions every subsequent Phase-12.6 sprint builds
  on: single Monaco over a virtual document (not one editor per
  cell), output-persistence schema keyed by
  ``(file_path, cell_id, kernel_session_id)``, cell identity
  via UUIDs written into jupytext cell-marker metadata under the
  custom ``pql_cell_id`` key (marker form
  ``# %% pql_cell_id="<uuid>"``; the filter
  ``cell_metadata_filter: pql_cell_id,-all`` pins it into the
  notebook frontmatter so jupytext preserves the key on
  round-trip).
- **Service layer.** ``pointlessql/services/notebook_doc.py``
  wraps jupytext for ``.py`` Percent-format load / save with a
  ``resolve_py_notebook_path`` traversal guard that mirrors the
  Sprint-27 upload helper.  First load of a foreign notebook
  mints UUIDs for any cell without one and flags the document
  ``dirty`` so the editor can prompt a save.
- **Routes.** ``GET /notebook/editor?path=<relative>`` renders
  the editor with the initial document as a JSON blob the
  Alpine component consumes synchronously on mount.  Missing
  files scaffold an empty cell and are materialised on first
  save.  ``POST /api/notebook/doc`` persists the client's cell
  list back to disk; the CSRF middleware gates it via the
  ``X-CSRF-Token`` header.  Both routes reject paths that
  escape the notebooks directory or lack a ``.py`` suffix.
- **Frontend.** ``frontend/templates/pages/notebook_editor.html``
  hosts a single Monaco instance; cell boundaries render as
  background colour bands via ``deltaDecorations``.  Add-cell
  inserts a ``# %% pql_cell_id="<uuid>"`` marker through
  ``editor.executeEdits`` — no DOM mount / unmount.  The
  client-side cell parser accepts only the canonical UUID
  marker form the server writes; foreign marker variants stay
  a jupytext-on-the-server concern.
- **Monaco vendoring.** ``scripts/vendor-monaco.sh`` pins
  monaco-editor 0.52.0, fetches the tarball from
  ``registry.npmjs.org`` and extracts ``min/vs`` into
  ``frontend/js/vendor/monaco/vs/``.  Contents are gitignored
  (~14 MB); run the script once after ``git clone`` and
  whenever ``MONACO_VERSION`` bumps.
- **Navbar.** "Notebook" becomes a dropdown — ``JupyterLab
  (classic)`` still points at the Sprint-3 iframe,
  ``Editor (preview)`` opens the new route at
  ``?path=scratch.py``.  Hard rule: the iframe stays live
  until Sprint 63.

### Added (Sprint 57) — UC Volumes (upload + convert-to-Delta)

Phase 12.5 closes with the "I have a CSV, make it go" moment.
Cross-repo work: soyuz-catalog gained file IO routes under
``{prefix}/volumes/{full_name}/files`` plus a ``file://`` storage
backend behind a ``VolumeFileBackend`` protocol
(soyuz commit f8ef973).

- **Service layer** (``pointlessql/services/volumes.py``).  Async
  httpx helpers — ``upload_file``, ``browse_files``,
  ``download_file`` (streaming), ``delete_file``, ``volume_url``,
  ``build_headers`` — that talk directly to the new soyuz
  endpoints, forwarding the caller's email as ``X-Principal`` so UC
  enforcement applies.  The generated client stubs have not been
  regenerated for these routes; the raw httpx layer unblocks Phase
  12.5 without a client-regen round-trip and will be swapped in
  after the soyuz tag bumps.
- **Routes.** ``GET /volumes`` list + ``GET /volumes/{full_name}``
  detail pages; ``GET|POST /api/volumes/{full_name}/files``
  (multipart upload + browse);
  ``DELETE /api/volumes/{full_name}/files/{path:path}``; and
  ``POST /api/volumes/{full_name}/convert-to-delta`` (admin-only).
- **Convert-to-Delta.**  Streams the source file out of soyuz into
  a temp path, reads it with DuckDB's ``read_csv_auto`` /
  ``read_parquet`` / ``read_json_auto``, writes a managed Delta
  directory inside the volume's ``file://`` root at
  ``_delta_<table>/``, inspects the Delta schema via ``deltalake``,
  and calls UC's ``create_table`` to register an ``EXTERNAL``
  table with the correct columns.  Only ``file://`` volumes are
  supported this sprint — cloud backends are a soyuz follow-up.
- **Audit.** ``volume.file_uploaded``, ``volume.file_deleted``,
  ``volume.converted_to_delta``.
- **Frontend.** ``pages/volumes.html`` (list) +
  ``pages/volume_detail.html`` (detail).  Upload form uses raw
  ``fetch(..., {body: FormData})`` with the CSRF header read from
  the ``<meta name="csrf-token">`` tag.  A per-file "Convert to
  Delta" button is rendered only for supported extensions
  (``.csv`` / ``.parquet`` / ``.json``).  Component scripts are
  non-module IIFEs that publish ``window.volumeDetail``
  synchronously before Alpine walks (Phase-12 trap #1 preempted).
- **Nav.**  "Volumes" entry in ``nav_links.html``.
- Tests: 6 new cases in ``tests/test_volumes.py`` — URL + header
  helpers + four httpx ``MockTransport`` round-trips covering
  upload (multipart body + X-Principal), browse (JSON list),
  delete (boolean), and download (streamed chunks).

### Added (Sprint 56) — Column statistics / data profiling

- **Alembic 016** — new ``table_stats`` table keyed by
  ``(full_name, delta_log_version, column_name)`` with a composite
  unique constraint + ``ix_table_stats_lookup`` for the read path.
- **Model.** ``TableStats`` under ``pointlessql/models.py``.
- **Service layer** (``pointlessql/services/table_stats.py``).
  ``read_delta_log_version`` wraps ``DeltaTable.version()``.
  ``compute_stats`` opens a DuckDB conn, registers the Delta view
  via the Sprint-49 ``register_delta_view`` helper, and issues one
  aggregate SQL per column plus a second ``GROUP BY`` when
  cardinality permits.  ``write_cached`` is idempotent,
  ``read_cached`` returns parsed dicts, ``delete_cached`` evicts
  every version.  Non-numeric columns never carry a ``mean``;
  ``top_5`` is skipped when ``distinct_count`` exceeds
  ``TOP_K_DISTINCT_CEILING`` (10 000 default).
- **Routes.**
  ``POST /api/tables/{full_name:path}/profile`` — SELECT-gated,
  checks the cache first, falls back to compute + write, emits one
  ``table.profiled`` or ``table.profile_cache_hit`` audit row.
  ``GET /api/tables/{full_name:path}/stats?version=<opt>`` —
  SELECT-gated read path.
  ``DELETE /api/tables/{full_name:path}/stats`` — admin-only
  eviction with a ``table.stats_cleared`` audit row.
- **Frontend.** New "Column statistics" card on the table detail
  page with Profile + admin-only Clear cache buttons; ``top_5`` bars
  render via Chart.js (reusing Sprint-54's CDN — zero extra network
  weight).  Non-module IIFE publishes ``window.tableStats``.
- Tests: 9 new cases in ``tests/test_table_stats.py`` — pure
  helpers (end-to-end compute against a Delta fixture, top_5 ceiling,
  cache round-trip, eviction, fresh-Delta version read) + HTTP
  surface (profile → cache-hit → stats round-trip, DELETE
  admin-only, profile enforces SELECT, 404 on unknown table).

### Added (Sprint 55) — Query alerts (CloudEvents webhook + Atom/JSON Feed)

- **Alembic 015** — ``alerts`` / ``alert_destinations`` /
  ``alert_events`` + ``users.feed_token``.  ``CHECK`` constraints on
  ``condition_op`` (``gt``/``lt``/``eq``/``ne``), ``kind``
  (``webhook``/``feed``), ``outcome`` (``fired``/``suppressed``/
  ``delivery_failed``).  Per-owner unique index on the nullable
  ``feed_token``.
- **Models.** ``Alert``, ``AlertDestination``, ``AlertEvent`` under
  ``pointlessql/models.py``; each alert holds a ``backing_job_id``
  FK so the existing scheduler drives firing via the new
  ``alert_check`` job-kind.
- **Service layer** (``pointlessql/services/alerts.py``).  Slug
  generation mirrors Sprint-51's saved-queries shape; CRUD with
  ``(user_id, is_admin)`` enforcement at the boundary; destination
  add/remove; event record/list/prune.  Pure helpers
  ``evaluate_condition`` + ``build_cloudevent`` are covered by
  dedicated tests.
- **Dispatcher** (``pointlessql/services/alert_dispatcher.py``).
  ``dispatch_webhook`` canonicalises the envelope with
  ``json.dumps(sort_keys=True, separators=(",",":"))`` so receivers
  can reserialise after decoding to verify HMAC-SHA256.  Timeouts
  ``connect=5s`` + ``read=10s``; retry ladder 2 extra attempts at
  1s / 2s backoff on 5xx / transport errors; 4xx is a permanent
  failure.
- **Feeds** (``pointlessql/services/alert_feeds.py``).  Atom 1.0
  via ``xml.etree.ElementTree`` with XML prolog; JSON Feed 1.1
  per ``jsonfeed.org/version/1.1``.  Both cap to last 30 days.
- **Scheduler wiring.** New ``_alert_check_executor`` registered
  under ``alert_check`` in ``build_default_registry``.  Reuses the
  existing ``KindRegistry`` + cron-tick infrastructure: the alert's
  hidden backing ``Job`` carries the user's cron expression, the
  executor parses + enforces + runs the saved query, evaluates the
  condition, inserts one ``AlertEvent``, and fans out dispatch.
  Delivery failure flips the event's ``outcome`` to
  ``delivery_failed`` via a second UPDATE.
- **CloudEvents envelope** ``data``: ``alert_slug`` +
  ``saved_query_slug`` + ``condition`` (``{op, threshold}``) +
  ``row_count`` + ``duration_ms`` + ``referenced_tables`` +
  ``fired_at``.  ``duration_ms`` + ``referenced_tables`` carried
  explicitly so Phase-13's EXPLAIN-agent cost-gate can consume the
  same webhook sink without a later payload-shape break.
- **Routes.** ``GET|POST /api/alerts``, ``GET|PATCH|DELETE
  /api/alerts/{slug}``, ``POST /api/alerts/{slug}/destinations``,
  ``DELETE /api/alerts/{slug}/destinations/{id}``,
  ``GET|POST /api/me/feed-token{,/rotate}``,
  ``GET /alerts/feed.atom?token=<opaque>`` returning
  ``application/atom+xml``, ``GET /alerts/feed.json?token=<opaque>``
  returning ``application/feed+json``, HTML pages ``/alerts`` (list)
  + ``/alerts/{slug}`` (detail with destinations + last 50 events).
  Every per-slug endpoint collapses missing + forbidden to 404.
- **Audit actions.** ``alert.created``, ``alert.updated``,
  ``alert.deleted``, ``alert.destination_added``,
  ``alert.destination_removed``, ``alert.feed_token_rotated`` —
  all through ``log_action`` wrapped in ``asyncio.to_thread``.
- **Frontend.** ``/alerts`` list with create-alert modal;
  ``/alerts/{slug}`` detail with destination manager;
  feed URLs panel with copy + rotate actions.  Non-module IIFEs
  publish ``window.alertsPage`` / ``window.alertDetail``
  synchronously (Phase-12 trap #1 preempted).
- **Nav.** New "Alerts" entry in ``nav_links.html``.
- Tests: 19 new cases in ``tests/test_alerts.py`` — condition
  evaluator, CloudEvents envelope shape, dispatcher HMAC +
  retry ladder, Atom + JSON feed parseability, service-level CRUD
  + owner gating, HTTP round-trip (create/list/delete/stranger 404/
  feed-token auth), scheduler executor (fires + records event +
  envelope parses).

### Added (Sprint 54) — Chart toolbar + chart_config persistence

- **Alembic 014** — ``ALTER TABLE query_history ADD COLUMN
  chart_config TEXT NULL``.  JSON-as-text carrying the user's chart
  selection ``{type, x, y}``; ``NULL`` means table view, which is
  correct for every pre-Sprint-54 row.
- **New routes.** ``GET /api/queries/{history_id}`` fetches a single
  row as JSON so the editor can seed its chart config when the page
  is deep-linked from ``/queries``.  ``PATCH /api/queries/{history_id}/
  chart-config`` persists the user's selection; payload is either
  ``{type, x, y}`` (server canonicalises via
  ``json.dumps(sort_keys=True)``) or ``null`` to clear.  Owner + admin
  only; 404 collapses missing + forbidden the same way the Sprint-51
  saved-queries surface does.  Audit action:
  ``query.chart_config_updated``.
- **`POST /api/sql/execute`** success payload now echoes
  ``history_id`` so the frontend's debounced PATCH knows which row
  to update without a second round-trip.
- **Service layer.** ``query_history.get_by_id`` + ``update_chart_config``
  alongside the existing record / list helpers; every mutation takes
  ``(user_id, is_admin)`` up-front so enforcement lives at the
  service boundary, not the route.
- **Chart.js 4.4.1 UMD** via jsDelivr in ``base.html``.  Non-module —
  the Phase-12 replay (commit b830300) burned us once on Alpine/ESM
  races; rule is "factories register on ``window.<lib>`` synchronously".
- **Frontend.** New ``viewMode`` / ``chartConfig`` / ``_chartInstance``
  state on the editor component, plus ``toggleView`` /
  ``renderChart`` / ``destroyChart`` / ``downloadChartPng`` /
  ``seedFromHistory`` methods.  Global ``c`` key toggles table ↔
  chart when focus is outside CodeMirror + form controls.  Results
  card now gates table vs. chart via ``<template x-if>`` branches
  with a Bootstrap btn-group view switch.  PNG download uses
  ``canvas.toBlob`` + an ephemeral ``<a download>``.
- **`/queries` re-run link** now carries ``&history_id=<id>`` so the
  editor's ``seedFromHistory`` fetch can seed the chart config.
- Tests: 7 new cases in ``tests/test_query_history_chart_config.py`` —
  service-level (write + clear + non-owner refusal) + HTTP (owner
  round-trip, null-clears, 422 on invalid payload, 404 for strangers
  on both GET and PATCH).

### Added (Sprint 53) — EXPLAIN + autocomplete + polish + Phase 12 close-out

- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE toggle.** Second button next to Run sends
  ``{explain: true}`` to ``/api/sql/execute``.  Server-side flow:
  parse + enforce as usual, then prepend ``EXPLAIN ANALYZE`` to
  the rewritten SQL and execute.  The multi-row plan output is
  flattened into a single ``explain_text`` string (tab-joined
  cells, newline-joined rows) that the editor drops into a
  ``<pre class="pql-sql-explain-panel">`` block.  EXPLAIN runs
  deliberately skip ``query_history`` and audit — they are
  diagnostic, not operational activity.
- **Catalog-tree autocomplete.** CodeMirror's ``autocompletion``
  extension wired to a custom completion source.  On mount, the
  editor fetches ``/api/tree`` once, flattens to
  ``catalog.schema.table`` strings, and serves them as
  completions whenever the caret touches a word.  Non-admin
  callers see only catalogs they have ``USE`` on — correct
  scope because you should not autocomplete something you can't
  query.  ``@codemirror/autocomplete@6.18.4`` is now in the
  import-map.
- **Mobile stacking.** New ``@media (max-width: 767.98px)`` block
  raises the editor's ``min-height`` so it dominates the
  viewport on phones; the Bootstrap grid already collapses the
  drawer under the editor at ``<lg`` breakpoints.  Results
  table stays horizontally scrollable so wide schemas don't
  overflow.
- **`g s` keyboard shortcut** for "Go to SQL editor" landed in
  Sprint 49 — documented here for the phase index.
- **Playbook.**
  [docs/e2e-walkthroughs/sql-editor.md](docs/e2e-walkthroughs/sql-editor.md) —
  16-step walkthrough covering the golden path (editor → run →
  save → history → re-run → CSV + Parquet export → EXPLAIN →
  cancel) and the two negative paths (non-admin without
  ``SELECT`` gets 403, non-admin can't see admin's private
  saved query gets 404).  Includes a Playwright-MCP script
  and a "Known-limit notes" block that calls out the
  single-worker cancel scope, the no-column autocomplete,
  and the silent row-cap on export.
- **Phase 12 closes.** ROADMAP flips the phase to ✅ done; every
  sprint 49-53 landed with its feat + ``docs(roadmap)`` pair.
- Tests: 1 new EXPLAIN route test in ``tests/test_sql_execute.py``
  (explain=true returns ``is_explain=True`` + non-empty
  ``explain_text``; history row count does not grow).

### Added (Sprint 52) — Export + timeout + cancel

- **`GET /api/sql/execute/{history_id}/download?format=csv|parquet`.**
  Re-runs a previously recorded query (reads ``sql_text`` from the
  :class:`QueryHistory` row, re-parses, re-fetches
  ``storage_location`` for every referenced table, re-enforces
  ``SELECT`` via ``check_privilege``) and streams the result out
  as either CSV (``StreamingResponse``, row-by-row generator) or
  Parquet (``pyarrow.parquet.write_table`` into a ``BytesIO`` +
  single ``Response``).  Filename pattern is
  ``query-{history_id}-{YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS}.{ext}``.  Non-owner
  non-admin callers receive 404 — history IDs are not a bypass.
  Row-cap applies so a huge download cannot be coerced by
  editing ``?format=``.  Emits a ``query.exported`` audit row
  with ``format`` + ``row_count`` in ``detail``.
- **Query timeout (``POINTLESSQL_SQL_QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``,
  default 60).** The execute route now dispatches the DuckDB
  call via :func:`asyncio.wait_for` and fires ``conn.interrupt()``
  on the pre-captured connection when the window elapses.  A
  timeout is recorded as ``status="cancelled"`` (not ``"failed"``)
  in ``query_history`` — the query may have been valid, just
  slow.
- **Cancel button.** New ``POST /api/sql/execute/{query_id}/cancel``
  endpoint looks up the client-supplied ``query_id`` in a
  per-app :class:`dict` of live :class:`duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection`
  handles (``app.state._live_queries``), calls ``.interrupt()``,
  and returns 204.  Unknown / already-completed IDs are 204 too —
  the client races the execute response and we want idempotence.
  Exceptions raised by ``.interrupt()`` are logged but swallowed
  so a flaky backend can't 500 the cancel request.  The
  ``/sql`` page shows an orange "Cancel" button + elapsed-seconds
  counter while a query is in flight; the Alpine component
  generates a ``crypto.randomUUID`` per run so each execute call
  carries a unique ``query_id`` and the Cancel button targets the
  right connection even if the user fires another query in rapid
  succession.  Execute responses now echo ``query_id`` so clients
  never have to reconstruct it.  Single-worker-correct only;
  multi-worker cancel is Phase 14.
- **`PQL.sql()` + `_run_sql_sync` + `_run_sql_export_sync` accept
  an optional pre-created ``conn``.** The route owns the
  connection lifecycle so it can register the handle in the
  cancel registry *before* the worker thread starts running —
  a race-free design.  The notebook-style entry point (``conn=None``)
  still creates + closes its own connection for callers that
  don't need cancel.
- **Audit actions.** ``query.exported``, ``query.cancelled`` join
  the Sprint-48 ``resource.verb`` Phase-12 vocabulary.
- Tests: 4 export cases in ``tests/test_sql_export_cancel.py``
  (CSV + Parquet round-trip against a small Delta table,
  missing-history 404, re-enforcement 404 for non-owner);
  3 cancel cases (interrupt invoked on registered conn, unknown
  qid → 204, backend raise swallowed → 204); 1 execute-shape
  case (the JSON response now carries ``query_id``).  The
  cancel tests are **fully mocked** — they never run a real
  long-running DuckDB query that would need actually aborting,
  so no risk of the test harness hanging on a regressed
  interrupt path.

### Added (Sprint 51) — Saved queries

- **Alembic 013** creates ``saved_queries`` (id, unique slug,
  title, optional description, ``sql_text`` TEXT, ``owner_id`` FK
  users, ``is_shared`` BOOL default FALSE, created_at, updated_at)
  plus a ``(owner_id, updated_at)`` index so the drawer's
  "most-recently-touched first" ordering is a single index scan.
- **Visibility model.** Owner + admin always see the row; every
  other logged-in user sees it only when ``is_shared = True``.
  Mutation (PATCH / DELETE / re-share) is restricted to owner +
  admin.  The ``/api/saved-queries/{slug}`` endpoints collapse
  "not found" and "forbidden" into a single 404 so unguessable
  slugs double as a mild privacy guard for private rows.
- **`services/saved_queries.py`** — pure helpers independent of
  FastAPI.  ``make_slug(title)`` derives a URL-safe identifier
  with a 6-char hex suffix (two users saving "Daily orders"
  don't collide).  ``create_saved_query``,
  ``list_visible``, ``get_by_slug``, ``update_by_slug``,
  ``delete_by_slug`` cover the full CRUD surface; every mutation
  takes the ``(user_id, is_admin)`` pair up-front so the
  enforcement is at the service boundary, not the route.
  ``ValidationError`` on empty title / empty SQL.
- **API.**
  - ``GET /api/saved-queries`` — list visible rows, admin or
    owner view, ordered by ``updated_at DESC`` (limit 200).
  - ``POST /api/saved-queries`` — create; audit tag
    ``query.saved`` (private) or ``query.shared`` (on creation
    with ``is_shared: true``).
  - ``GET /api/saved-queries/{slug}`` — single lookup, 404 on
    miss or privacy.
  - ``PATCH /api/saved-queries/{slug}`` — partial update; audit
    tag ``query.updated`` unless the sharing flag flipped, in
    which case ``query.shared`` / ``query.unshared``.
  - ``DELETE /api/saved-queries/{slug}`` → 204; audit tag
    ``query.deleted``.
- **Editor sidebar drawer.** New ``components/saved_queries_drawer.html``
  included on ``/sql`` as a 3-col right-hand column on desktop
  (Sprint-53 will add the mobile stack).  Shows title +
  description + owner email + "shared" badge; click the title
  to load into the editor, click the red ``x`` to delete with a
  confirm dialog.
- **Save current query modal + Cmd+S.** ``<div id="pqlSaveQueryModal">``
  renders a Bootstrap modal with title / description / shared
  checkbox.  CodeMirror's ``Mod-s`` keybind and a new "Save"
  button next to "Run" both open the modal; on submit
  ``pqlApi.fetch('POST /api/saved-queries')`` creates the row
  and refreshes the drawer.
- **Audit actions.** ``query.saved``, ``query.shared``,
  ``query.unshared``, ``query.updated``, ``query.deleted`` —
  every new audit string follows the Sprint-48 ``resource.verb``
  convention settled for Phase 12.
- Tests: 11 new cases in ``tests/test_saved_queries.py`` —
  slug generation + sanitising, empty title/SQL validation,
  private peer query hidden from non-owner, shared query visible
  to non-owner, PATCH/DELETE by non-owner returns None/False,
  owner toggles ``is_shared``, full API round-trip (create →
  list → get → private-is-404-for-other-user → PATCH-by-non-
  owner-404 → DELETE-204).

### Added (Sprint 50) — Query history

- **Alembic 012** creates two new tables. ``query_history``
  (``id``, ``user_id``, ``user_email``, ``sql_text`` TEXT,
  ``started_at`` + ``finished_at``, ``status`` CHECK IN
  ``succeeded|failed|cancelled``, nullable ``row_count`` /
  ``duration_ms`` / ``error_message``, ``request_id`` for
  Sprint-16 log correlation) with composite indexes on
  ``(user_id, started_at)`` and a forward index on
  ``started_at``.  ``query_history_tables`` (``id``,
  ``query_history_id`` FK, ``full_name``, ``access_type``
  defaulting to ``"read"``) with a reverse-lookup index on
  ``(full_name, query_history_id)`` so the "who queried table X"
  pattern is a single index seek.
- **`POST /api/sql/execute` now persists history on both paths.**
  Success and failure each write a ``query_history`` row via the
  new :func:`_record_query_async` helper, which dispatches the
  INSERT through :func:`asyncio.to_thread` (same pattern as
  Sprint-48's ``_audit``).  Parse failures log an empty
  ``referenced_tables`` array; enforcement failures carry the
  refs that were extracted before ``check_privilege`` raised.
  ``error_message`` is the exception detail verbatim so the
  ``/queries`` detail panel can surface DuckDB's "column not
  found" without a second fetch.
- **`GET /queries` page** — Jinja template ``pages/queries.html``
  driven by the Sprint-33 ``listTable`` Alpine component.  Filter
  chips: *Mine only*, *Failed*, *Last 24h*.  Each row renders a
  status badge, SQL snippet (truncated at 120 chars with an
  expand-to-show-error toggle for failed rows), referenced-table
  chips, a duration, and a re-run button that links to
  ``/sql?prefill=<urlencoded sql>``.  Non-admin callers see only
  their own rows — enforcement lives in
  :func:`api_list_queries` and mirrors Sprint-33's ``/api/jobs``
  scoping.  The page opts into the Sprint-36 ``r``-refresh via
  ``list_page: True`` in its template context.
- **`GET /api/queries?user_id=&status=&since=&limit=`** — JSON
  endpoint the page preloads from.  ``since`` accepts ``24h`` /
  ``7d`` / ``30d`` / ``all`` (anything else → no filter, never a
  400).  Admin-only scoping: a non-admin's ``user_id`` is
  clamped to their own ID.  Hard cap at 1000 rows even if the
  caller asks for more.
- **Editor prefill.** ``sql_editor.js`` now reads
  ``?prefill=<urlencoded sql>`` on mount and seeds the CodeMirror
  doc with it.  URL cleanup via ``history.replaceState`` so a
  page reload isn't a second re-run.  Pattern lifted verbatim
  from Sprint-27's ``prefill_notebook_path`` in ``pages/jobs.html``.
- **Navbar collapses Notebook/SQL.** The new "SQL" nav entry
  becomes a dropdown with *Editor* → ``/sql`` and *History* →
  ``/queries``.  ``g s`` still jumps to the editor;
  Sprint 50 adds ``g q`` chord for the history.
- Tests: 5 new service cases in ``tests/test_query_history.py``
  (happy record, failure-with-error-message, user+status
  filtering, reverse table lookup, count) plus 4 new route cases
  (execute writes succeeded history, parse-fail writes failed
  history, non-admin sees only own rows on ``/api/queries``,
  ``/queries`` page renders).

### Added (Sprint 49) — SQL editor MVP

- **`POST /api/sql/execute` + `GET /sql` page.** First Phase 12 sprint.
  A dedicated ad-hoc SQL surface next to the Notebook tab: the user
  types ``SELECT … FROM catalog.schema.table`` in a CodeMirror-6
  editor, presses :kbd:`Cmd+Enter`, and sees the result table
  inline.  No history, no save, no export, no EXPLAIN, no cancel
  yet — those land in Sprints 50-53.
- **`PQL.sql()` + DuckDB-only engine for SQL.** Phase-5's
  ``POINTLESSQL_DELTA_ENGINE`` still drives :meth:`PQL.table` reads,
  but ad-hoc SQL is hard-wired to DuckDB (``duckdb`` was already a
  dep).  The new :meth:`pointlessql.pql.pql.PQL.sql` is a
  :func:`staticmethod` that opens a fresh DuckDB connection per
  request, registers every referenced Delta table as a view, runs
  the query, caps the result at ``POINTLESSQL_SQL_MAX_ROWS`` (default
  10 000), and returns a JSON-friendly ``SQLResult`` dataclass.
- **sqlglot-based 3-part-reference parser + rewriter.** New
  ``pointlessql/pql/sql_parser.py`` parses the user's SQL once with
  ``sqlglot.parse(dialect="duckdb")`` and returns a ``PreparedSQL``
  carrying (a) the distinct ``catalog.schema.table`` references in
  first-appearance order and (b) a rewritten form where each 3-part
  reference is collapsed to a single quoted identifier.  DuckDB
  reserves ``main`` as a catalog name and refuses to bind 3-part UC
  references natively; the route registers each Delta view at
  exactly that quoted identifier so the rewrite binds.  CTE
  aliases, subquery aliases, and 2-part / 1-part references are
  handled correctly (skipped or rejected).
- **Per-table SELECT enforcement.** The route fetches
  ``storage_location`` + effective permissions from soyuz-catalog
  for every referenced table and calls :func:`check_privilege` with
  ``SELECT``.  Admin short-circuits per the Phase 7 behaviour.  A
  missing grant raises :class:`AuthorizationError`, which the
  Sprint-44 RFC 9457 handler renders as
  ``application/problem+json`` with ``required_privilege=SELECT`` +
  ``full_name`` extension members.
- **Audit on execute.** Every successful call writes a
  ``query.executed`` audit row (per ROADMAP's Sprint-48 follow-up:
  Phase 12 audit actions use the ``resource.verb`` convention).
  The ``target`` is a truncated-SHA256 hash of the SQL so identical
  queries from different users collapse into one reverse-lookup key
  without blowing out the audit row width; ``detail`` carries a
  dict with ``row_count``, ``duration_ms``, referenced ``tables``,
  and the ``truncated`` flag.
- **CodeMirror 6 via CDN import-map.** The new ``pages/sql_editor.html``
  loads ``@codemirror/state``, ``@codemirror/view``,
  ``@codemirror/lang-sql`` and ``@codemirror/theme-one-dark``
  straight from ``cdn.jsdelivr.net`` through a ``<script type=
  "importmap">`` — matches the existing Bootstrap/Alpine/htmx CDN
  strategy.  Vendoring is deferred until a CSP or offline-install
  requirement makes it necessary.
- **Navbar + shortcut.** New "SQL" entry in
  ``components/nav_links.html`` (between Notebook and Jobs; shown
  to every logged-in user, not admin-gated — everyone is allowed
  to query what they have ``SELECT`` on).  ``g s`` added to the
  command-palette chord registry (``components/command_palette.html``)
  so ``g s`` from any page jumps to ``/sql``.
- **Settings.** New :class:`pointlessql.settings.SQLSettings`
  sub-model.  ``POINTLESSQL_SQL_ENABLED`` (default ``True``),
  ``POINTLESSQL_SQL_MAX_ROWS`` (default 10 000), and
  ``POINTLESSQL_SQL_QUERY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` (default 60 — the
  timeout knob is declared now; wiring lands in Sprint 52).  Set
  ``POINTLESSQL_SQL_ENABLED=false`` and the ``/sql`` page renders
  a disabled placeholder while ``/api/sql/execute`` returns a
  400 ``sql_execution_error``.
- **New exception ``SQLExecutionError``.** ``status_code=400``,
  ``error_code="sql_execution_error"``.  Covers both parse-time
  rejections (multi-statement, non-SELECT, 2-part refs) and
  DuckDB's own runtime errors (unknown column, type mismatch, …).
  Both surface the message verbatim so the user can fix their
  query without guessing.
- **Deps.** Added ``sqlglot>=26.0`` (resolved to 30.4.3 at lock
  time).  CodeMirror is CDN-loaded; no Python-side dep needed.
- Tests: 13 new unit tests in ``tests/test_sql_parser.py`` covering
  single refs, joins, CTE aliases, subqueries, deduplication,
  no-table queries, bad-format rejection, and the DuckDB rewrite
  output shape.  8 new route tests in ``tests/test_sql_execute.py``
  covering admin happy path, non-admin-without-SELECT 403,
  non-admin-with-SELECT happy path, malformed SQL 400, 2-part
  rejection 400, row-cap truncation, zero-table SELECT 1, and
  ``/sql`` page render.

### Added (Sprint 48) — audit-log hardening

- **Append-only ORM guards.** :class:`AuditLog` ``before_update``
  and ``before_delete`` SQLAlchemy event listeners raise a new
  :class:`AuditIntegrityError`; every existing audit row is
  effectively immutable at the ORM layer. The retention cleanup
  path opens a :class:`~contextvars.ContextVar` (the
  ``_allow_audit_mutation`` scope) to bypass the delete guard —
  that's the only way to remove a row through the ORM. Raw SQL
  can still bypass; deployments that need true WORM should layer
  PostgreSQL ``REVOKE DELETE`` on top. Pattern ported verbatim
  from ``shoreguard-fresh/shoreguard/services/audit.py:46–115``.
- **Async audit writes.** :func:`api.main._audit` now dispatches
  the INSERT via :func:`asyncio.to_thread`, so request handlers
  never block on the audit DB round-trip. The rate-limit
  middleware's ``rate_limit.blocked`` hook uses the same async
  path. All 22 call sites in ``api/main.py`` were rewritten to
  ``await _audit(…)``.
- **Structured ``detail`` and richer columns.** Alembic ``011``
  widens ``audit_log.detail`` from ``String(2000)`` to ``Text``
  and adds ``client_ip`` (IPv4/IPv6, nullable) + ``actor_role``
  (``admin``/``user``/``system``, defaults to ``user``). The
  :func:`log_action` helper accepts a JSON-encodable dict for
  ``detail`` and JSON-encodes it; plain-string callers still
  work for backwards compatibility.
- **Retention policy.** New :class:`AuditSettings` sub-model
  exposes ``POINTLESSQL_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`` (default 365) and
  ``POINTLESSQL_AUDIT_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` (default 86 400).
  A lifespan-owned background task calls
  :func:`cleanup_old_entries` on that cadence; failures are
  logged and swallowed. Setting ``retention_days=0`` disables
  the sweep entirely (pre-Sprint-48 behaviour).
- **JSON + CSV export.** New ``GET /admin/audit/export?fmt=json|csv``
  endpoint mirrors the viewer's filter surface (``since`` / ``action`` /
  ``user`` / ``target``) and streams a filename-stamped attachment,
  capped at 10 000 rows per call. Two new "Export" buttons in the
  Sprint-41 viewer build the same query string so operators get
  "what you see is what you download".
- **Viewer surfaces new columns.** The admin-audit template gains a
  Role badge column (admin/user/system styling) and a compact IP
  column. Existing search/sort/chip behaviour ported over the new
  ``data-sort-*`` attributes.

### Fixed (Sprint 48, tests)

- ``tests/test_admin_audit.py`` + ``tests/test_rate_limit.py``
  migrated from ``MagicMock(secret_key=…)`` fixtures to real
  :class:`Settings` instances (Sprint 47 missed these two files),
  and both now pin their engines to ``StaticPool +
  check_same_thread=False`` so the Sprint-48 async audit writes
  can hand the factory to ``asyncio.to_thread`` without the
  worker seeing an empty in-memory DB.

### Fixed (Sprint 47) — test-suite regressions

- **In-memory SQLite test schemas survive the worker thread.**
  ``asyncio.to_thread``-backed code paths (``_build_home_summary``'s
  ``_db_block``) hit the engine from a separate thread, and the
  default ``QueuePool`` + ``sqlite:///:memory:`` combination gives
  each worker its own empty database — tests that touched ``/`` or
  ``/catalogs/…`` reported "no such table: jobs" even though the
  root-conftest ran ``Base.metadata.create_all``. Fix: pin every
  in-memory engine to ``StaticPool`` + ``check_same_thread=False``
  in ``tests/conftest.py`` and ``tests/test_auth_routes.py``. No
  production code changes.
- **403 enforcement tests match the rendered title case.**
  ``test_enforcement.py`` still asserted the pre-Sprint-30
  ``"Access Denied"`` title; the current 403 template renders
  ``"Access denied"`` (lowercase ``d``) via ``_STATUS_TITLES`` and
  hardcoded copy. Two assertions updated.
- **``test_list_tables`` matches the current soyuz-catalog-client
  wire format.** ``ListTablesResponse(identifiers=…)`` → ``tables=…``
  after the v0.2 rename (the production ``pql.list_tables`` already
  reads ``response.tables``).

### Added (Sprint 46)

- **Graceful JWT signing-key rotation.** Final Phase 11 hardening
  sprint. A new optional ``POINTLESSQL_AUTH_SECRET_KEY_PREVIOUS``
  env var lets operators rotate the primary signing key without
  invalidating every outstanding session. New tokens are always
  signed with the primary key; ``verify_jwt`` tries the primary
  first and falls back to the previous key only if the primary
  rejects the token. Expired, tampered, or third-key tokens still
  fail under both. Rotation procedure:

  1. Set ``POINTLESSQL_AUTH_SECRET_KEY_PREVIOUS`` to the *current*
     (old) key value.
  2. Change ``POINTLESSQL_AUTH_SECRET_KEY`` to the new value.
     Restart / recreate the container so both settings are picked
     up at the same time.
  3. Wait for ``jwt_expiry_hours`` (default 168 h = 7 d) so every
     live session has either re-logged-in or naturally timed out.
     During this window, fresh logins emit tokens signed with the
     new key while existing cookies continue to verify under the
     old.
  4. Drop ``POINTLESSQL_AUTH_SECRET_KEY_PREVIOUS``. Any cookie
     still signed with the old key now fails verification and the
     user is bounced to ``/auth/login``.

  When ``secret_key_previous`` is unset (the default) the fallback
  path is disabled and a key change invalidates every live session
  immediately. Six new unit tests in ``tests/test_auth.py`` cover
  the happy path, fresh tokens during rotation, unknown keys,
  missing-fallback rejection, expiry preservation, and
  ``get_current_user``'s ``previous_key`` threading.

### Changed (Sprint 45) — BREAKING: nested Settings + renamed env vars

- **Flat `Settings` split into nine `BaseSettings` sub-models.** Fifth
  Phase 11 hardening sprint, porting the shoreguard-fresh nested-
  settings pattern 1:1.  Each sub-model owns its own ``env_prefix``:
  ``ServerSettings``, ``SoyuzSettings``, ``DatabaseSettings``,
  ``AuthSettings``, ``OIDCSettings``, ``LoggingSettings``,
  ``RateLimitSettings``, ``JupyterSettings``, ``SchedulerSettings``,
  ``DeltaSettings``.  Access moves from ``settings.secret_key`` to
  ``settings.auth.secret_key``, from ``settings.notebooks_dir`` to
  ``settings.jupyter.notebooks_dir``, etc.  Most environment
  variables are unchanged because the old flat prefix already
  overlapped — ``POINTLESSQL_RATE_LIMIT_*``,
  ``POINTLESSQL_SCHEDULER_*``, ``POINTLESSQL_OIDC_*``,
  ``POINTLESSQL_JUPYTER_*``, ``POINTLESSQL_SOYUZ_CATALOG_URL``,
  ``POINTLESSQL_LOG_LEVEL``, ``POINTLESSQL_LOG_FORMAT`` all still
  read the same value.  The breaking subset:

  | Old                                          | New                                              |
  | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
  | ``POINTLESSQL_HOST``                         | ``POINTLESSQL_SERVER_HOST``                      |
  | ``POINTLESSQL_PORT``                         | ``POINTLESSQL_SERVER_PORT``                      |
  | ``POINTLESSQL_BASE_URL``                     | ``POINTLESSQL_SERVER_BASE_URL``                  |
  | ``POINTLESSQL_DATABASE_URL``                 | ``POINTLESSQL_DB_URL``                           |
  | ``POINTLESSQL_SECRET_KEY``                   | ``POINTLESSQL_AUTH_SECRET_KEY``                  |
  | ``POINTLESSQL_JWT_EXPIRY_HOURS``             | ``POINTLESSQL_AUTH_JWT_EXPIRY_HOURS``            |
  | ``POINTLESSQL_ENGINE``                       | ``POINTLESSQL_DELTA_ENGINE``                     |
  | ``POINTLESSQL_NOTEBOOKS_DIR``                | ``POINTLESSQL_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOKS_DIR``            |
  | ``POINTLESSQL_NOTEBOOK_EXECUTE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` | ``POINTLESSQL_JUPYTER_EXECUTE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` |

  The ``docker-compose.yml`` and ``docker-compose.postgres.yml``
  default env blocks were updated in this sprint; the
  ``docker-compose.e2e.yml`` overlay accepts both the old and new
  ``BASE_URL`` name for a one-release transition.  Tests that built
  ``Settings`` with flat kwargs (``Settings(secret_key="…")``) must
  switch to nested dict kwargs (``Settings(auth={"secret_key":
  "…"})``).  The validator that anchors ``notebooks_dir`` to the
  startup CWD (BUG-28-02) and the ``oidc.enabled`` computed field
  both carried over unchanged — see ``pointlessql/settings.py`` for
  the new shape.

### Changed (Sprint 44) — BREAKING: error envelope shape

- **Error responses migrated to RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`.**
  Fourth Phase 11 hardening sprint. The previous nested envelope
  `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "...", "request_id": "..."}}`
  is replaced by a flat top-level body `{"type": "about:blank",
  "title": "<status title>", "status": <code>, "detail": "<message>",
  "code": "<identifier>", "request_id": "..."}` served with
  `Content-Type: application/problem+json`. Domain `AuthorizationError`
  surfaces its `required_privilege`, `securable_type`, and `full_name`
  as RFC 9457 extension members; FastAPI's `RequestValidationError`
  flows through the same envelope with an `errors` array extension.
  API clients that read the old nested `.error.code` / `.error.message`
  fields must switch to top-level `.code` / `.detail`. The only known
  clients — PointlesSQL's own frontend via `frontend/js/api.js` and
  two Alpine templates — were updated in the same sprint.

### Added (Sprint 44)

- **HTMX toast bridge for inline errors.** Non-boosted HTMX fragment
  requests (`HX-Request: true` without `HX-Boosted: true`) that raise
  a domain error now receive an empty body at the real error status
  plus an `HX-Trigger` header carrying a `pqlToast` event. A
  `base.html` listener forwards level + message + request_id into the
  existing Sprint-30 `window.pqlToast.error` API so the user sees an
  inline Bootstrap toast without losing the current page. Boosted
  navigations keep the branded HTML error page so htmx can still swap
  `#main-content`. The primary consumer is the upcoming Phase-12 SQL
  editor: a failed query can now surface as a toast without the
  editor losing focus.
- **Three new domain exceptions.** `SchedulerError` (scheduler
  plumbing failures pre-notebook-run), `NotebookRenderError`
  (nbconvert failures, previously misclassified as generic
  `EngineError`), and `PQLWriteError` (subclasses `EngineError` so
  existing catches keep working, but its own code lets the UI
  distinguish write failures from read/compute failures).
  `services/notebook_render.py` now raises `NotebookRenderError`
  instead of `EngineError`; `tests/test_notebook_render.py` updated.
- **Playbook `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/error-handling.md`** covers
  problem+json media type on `/api/*`, HTMX toast trigger without
  page swap, boosted-navigation HTML fallback, and 403 extension
  members.

### Added (Sprint 43)

- **Rate limiting on `/auth/*`.** Third Phase 11 hardening sprint. A
  new `rate_limit_middleware` enforces per-IP and per-email fixed-
  window caps on the auth surface: 10/10min per IP + 5/10min per
  submitted email on `POST /auth/login`, 5/1h per IP on
  `POST /auth/register`, and a shared 20/10min per-IP bucket across
  `GET /auth/sso` + `GET /auth/callback`. Buckets live in a new
  `rate_limit_events` table (Alembic migration `010`) so the limiter
  ships with zero new runtime dependencies — no Redis, no slowapi,
  no background sweeper. Opportunistic cleanup inside every check
  `DELETE`s rows older than the window, and the composite
  `(bucket, created_at)` index covers both the count and the
  delete. The middleware sits between CSRF (outer) and auth (inner)
  so cross-site forged floods still fail the cheap CSRF check
  before they can burn a slot, while CSRF-clean abuse is caught
  before bcrypt + JWT-decode run on every attempt. Rejections
  return 429 with a `Retry-After` header and emit an
  `audit_log` row with `action="rate_limit.blocked"` so the
  Sprint-41 `/admin/audit` viewer surfaces the feature without a
  second dashboard. The `rate_limit_trust_x_forwarded_for` setting
  defaults OFF and must be flipped on explicitly behind a known
  reverse proxy — otherwise any client could forge the header and
  escape the per-IP bucket; the per-email axis still catches
  distributed attacks that probe one account from many IPs. New
  playbook `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/rate-limit.md` and
  `tests/test_rate_limit.py` cover login + register + OIDC floors,
  window expiry, the `/healthz` and `/api/*` exemptions, body
  re-injection, and the audit hook.

### Added (Sprint 42)

- **CSRF protection for HTML form routes.** Second Phase 11 hardening
  sprint. A new `csrf_middleware` implements the OWASP
  double-submit-cookie pattern: every request without a `pql_csrf`
  cookie gets one (`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, matches the JWT
  cookie's `max_age`), and every non-safe method outside `/api/`,
  `/static/`, or `/healthz` must echo that cookie back via either a
  `csrf_token` form field or an `X-CSRF-Token` header. The
  `base.html` HTMX hook auto-attaches the header for every
  boosted request from the `<meta name="csrf-token">` tag, so
  existing HTMX flows pick up protection with zero per-route edits.
  A new `{{ csrf_input() }}` Jinja macro wires the three non-boosted
  forms (login, register, logout). Token rotates on local-login,
  OIDC-login, and logout to prevent fixation; failed login keeps the
  existing cookie so retry works without a page reload. New playbook
  `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/csrf.md` and `tests/test_csrf.py` cover
  cookie issuance, both submission paths, rotation, the `/api/*`
  exemption, and body re-injection so downstream handlers still see
  posted fields.

### Added (Sprint 41)

- **Admin audit-log viewer at `/admin/audit`.** First sprint of
  Phase 11 (Hardening). The Sprint-7 `audit_log` table has been
  write-only since it landed; Sprint 41 adds the read side. Admins
  get a filterable, newest-first list view that reuses the `/jobs`
  `listTable` Alpine component, the `pql-list-*` CSS, and the
  existing `_require_admin` gate — no new frontend primitives. The
  route supports four server-side filters (`since=24h|7d|30d|all`,
  `action=`, `user=` substring, `target=` substring) plus a client-
  side "Mine only" chip. A new Alembic migration `009` adds
  `ix_audit_log_created` so the cross-user "latest N" ordering
  query has a supporting index. New "Admin" dropdown in the top
  navbar (admin-only, gated in `components/nav_links.html`)
  anchors the `/admin/*` namespace that Phase 11's remaining
  sprints will extend. New playbook
  `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/admin-audit.md` replays the flow.

### Changed

- **`ROADMAP.md`.** Opened ⏳ entries for four forward-looking
  phases with a deliberate sequence: hardening first, features
  second, public launch last. **Phase 11 (Hardening)** — CSRF
  on HTML forms, rate limiting on `/auth/*` and future
  `/api/sql/*`, graceful `secret_key` rotation, admin audit-log
  viewer reusing the `/jobs` list-table machinery.
  **Phase 12 (SQL editor + query history)** — CodeMirror `/sql`
  page, DuckDB-only `PQL.sql()` with sqlglot-based table
  resolution, `query_history` + `query_history_tables` Alembic
  migration, saved queries, export, EXPLAIN, `g s` shortcut.
  **Phase 13 (Agent workloads — sketch)** —
  `paperclip-adapter-pointlessql` companion repo, new
  `agent_run` job kind, `X-Principal`-into-sandbox for UC
  enforcement on agent queries, read-only `/agents` discovery
  page; plus two uncommitted follow-ons (ontology / Foundry-
  lite; OSINT pattern playbook). **Phase 14 (Public launch +
  external distribution — queued last)** — GHCR private→public
  flip + Phase-10-deferred packaging replay, multi-arch builds,
  public PyPI publish, optional Helm chart, positioning /
  license decisions. Phase 14 is deliberately queued for the
  end per the Phase 10 retrospective ("release engineering
  against a private audience generates self-inflicted
  friction"). No code touched — these entries anchor scope
  discussed in-session so later sessions pick up where this
  one left off.

## [0.1.0rc3] - 2026-04-18

### Added (Sprint 40)

- **`.github/workflows/docker.yml`.** On-tag image publish to
  GHCR. Builds both the PointlesSQL image (from `Dockerfile`) and
  the soyuz-catalog image (from `Dockerfile.soyuz` with a
  `build-contexts: soyuz-catalog=soyuz-catalog` overlay pointing at
  a just-cloned soyuz-catalog checkout). Pushes to
  `ghcr.io/flohofstetter/pointlessql:<tag>` and
  `ghcr.io/flohofstetter/soyuz-catalog:<pinned-soyuz-tag>`. The
  soyuz tag is parsed from `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.uv.sources]`
  at workflow time so no hard-coded version lives in CI. A
  `verify-soyuz-tag-exists` step does `git ls-remote` with
  `SOYUZ_READ_TOKEN` before building — fails fast on a
  never-pushed tag, guarding against the Sprint 37 `v0.2.0rc1`
  failure mode. Prerelease tags (`rc*`, `a[0-9]*`, `b[0-9]*`,
  `dev[0-9]*`) do not get the `:latest` alias, matching the
  `release.yml` regex.
- **GHCR image labels.** Both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.soyuz`
  grew `ARG VCS_REF` / `ARG VERSION` + `LABEL
  org.opencontainers.image.{source,revision,version,title,
  description,licenses}` on the runtime stage. `docker.yml`
  passes `--build-arg VCS_REF=${github.sha} --build-arg
  VERSION=${github.ref_name}`. The `source` label is what GHCR
  uses to link the package to the repo sidebar.
- **`docs/install.md`.** First formal install guide. Three
  flavours: Docker + GHCR images (recommended primary), pip
  install from git tag, source checkout for contributors. Each
  ends with an "expected state" assertion and a troubleshooting
  section calls out the usual landmines — `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0`
  silently dropping `--mount=type=secret`, fine-grained PAT
  requiring per-repo grants vs. classic-PAT scopes just working,
  stale `/app/data` SQLite after a version bump.
- **`docs/e2e-walkthroughs/packaging.md`.** Eleventh playbook —
  the clean-machine flow. Preconditions assert the Sprint 40 tag
  has shipped and images exist on GHCR. Steps: `cd
  "$(mktemp -d)"`, assert anonymous `docker pull` fails
  (proves the images are private), `docker login ghcr.io`, re-pull
  succeeds, `curl` the compose file at the tag, `sed` flips
  `build:` → `image:`, `docker compose pull && up -d`, healthcheck
  poll, Playwright MCP `browser_navigate` asserts the home-page
  Welcome `<h1>`, `docker image inspect` confirms
  `org.opencontainers.image.source` labels, teardown. Found-bugs
  section left with the `(none at time of writing — fill in
  during the first live replay)` placeholder that matches
  Phase 7/8/9 convention. Index in
  `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/README.md` grew a third section
  (`Packaging`).

### Changed (Sprint 40)

- **`Dockerfile` dual auth.** The single `--mount=type=ssh` RUN
  grew a second mount: `--mount=type=secret,id=gh_pat`, both
  `required=false`. Inline shell branch prefers the token if
  `/run/secrets/gh_pat` is non-empty, else falls back to the
  ssh-agent path. Sprint 38's `docker compose build --ssh default`
  contributor flow still works; the new `GH_PAT=$(gh auth token)
  docker compose build` path is what CI + clean-machine users hit.
- **`docker-compose.yml`.** The `pointlessql` service's `build:`
  block grew `secrets: - gh_pat` alongside the existing `ssh:
  [default]`; a top-level `secrets: gh_pat: { environment:
  GH_PAT }` block wires the env var to the BuildKit secret file.
  Each service also grew a commented `# image: ghcr.io/…:<tag>`
  line above its `build:` block with a two-line explainer so
  clean-machine users can flip to the pull path with a
  comment-out-and-uncomment edit.
- **`README.md` quickstart.** "Quick start (Docker + GHCR
  images)" is now the primary top-level install path — `docker
  login ghcr.io` → `curl docker-compose.yml` → flip two lines →
  `docker compose pull && up`. The `../soyuz-catalog` sibling
  prerequisite is gone from this section. Source-build demoted to
  "Quick start (local development)" below it; both sections
  cross-link to `docs/install.md`.
- **`CLAUDE.md`.** "Docker builds" subsection rewritten for
  dual-auth; new "GHCR images" subsection documents the on-tag
  publish pipeline + the PAT-based pull flow. "Replaying the e2e
  walkthroughs" bumped playbook count ten → eleven.

### Docs (Sprint 40)

- **`ROADMAP.md`.** Sprint 40 flipped to ✅. Phase 10 flipped to
  ✅ done. Phase 10 close-out block added following the
  Phase 7/8/9 shape: what the phase bought (clean `git clone &&
  uv sync` for source, clean `docker login && compose pull && up`
  for users, every future release cuts a GH Release plus two
  GHCR images automatically), plus Deferred-to-Phase-11 list
  (multi-arch arm64, PyPI publish, Helm chart, public-GHCR flip).

## [0.1.0rc2] - 2026-04-18

### Fixed (Sprint 38 follow-on)

- **Dual-mode dev toggle.** The documented escape hatch — dropping
  a gitignored `uv.toml` with a `[sources]` block to flip
  `soyuz-catalog-client` to the sibling `../soyuz-catalog`
  checkout — was rejected by `uv` with `error: Failed to parse:
  uv.toml. The sources field is not allowed in a uv.toml file.
  sources is only applicable in the context of a project`. The
  mechanism never actually worked; Sprint 38's smoke test only
  covered the default-pinned path. Replaced with two helper
  scripts, `scripts/use-editable-soyuz.sh` and
  `scripts/use-pinned-soyuz.sh`, that swap `[tool.uv.sources]` in
  `pyproject.toml` in-place. The swap intentionally leaves the
  tree dirty so the escape-hatch state stays visible. `.gitignore`
  loses its `uv.toml` stanza (the mechanism is gone); `CLAUDE.md`
  "Wiring soyuz-catalog" rewrites the editable-hatch section.

### Changed (Sprint 39 follow-on — CI)

- **`.github/workflows/test.yml` + `release.yml`.** Torn out the
  broken sibling-checkout + `uv.toml`-drop construction. Both
  workflows now consume the private `soyuz-catalog` dep the same
  way a local checkout does: `uv sync` resolves the pinned
  `[tool.uv.sources]` git-tag source, authenticated by a single
  `git config --global url."https://x-access-token:${SOYUZ_READ_TOKEN}@github.com/".insteadOf "https://github.com/"`
  step before `uv sync`. Removed: the debug curl-probes step, the
  raw `git clone --branch v0.2.0rc2 …` sibling-checkout step, the
  `cat > uv.toml <<EOF [sources] …` override step, and every
  `working-directory: PointlesSQL` (the main checkout lives at
  the default path again).
- **`SOYUZ_READ_TOKEN` preflight.** Added a 2-check gate step
  before `uv sync`: length ≥ 30 bytes (catches empty/truncated
  paste) and `GET https://api.github.com/user` returning 200
  (catches a revoked, expired, or typo'd PAT). Fails with a
  `::error::` annotation whose prose tells the maintainer exactly
  where to re-paste. No token material is echoed. Cost is one
  HTTPS request per run; saves a minute of dep resolution on
  every bad-secret state.
- **Alembic gate needs a migrated target.** `alembic check` on a
  fresh runner produced `FAILED: Target database is not up to
  date.` — the runner has no `pointlessql.db`, so `check` has
  nothing to compare the ORM models against. Workflows now run
  `alembic upgrade head` before `alembic check` so the sqlite
  file exists at the latest revision. Locally unchanged — the
  developer's working DB is already at head.

### Notes on external fix (SOYUZ_READ_TOKEN)

The previous org-secret values were all rejected by GitHub
(the first at `3ceaf45` was 1 byte; the later re-pastes were
40-byte strings that GitHub returned HTTP 401 for on
`/user`). The 16-commit `fix(ci)` investigation on main was
this plus the `uv.toml` bug tangled up. Resolved by pasting a
freshly-generated fine-grained PAT with `Contents: Read` on
`FloHofstetter/soyuz-catalog` into the repo secret. File
content unchanged.



### Added (Sprint 39)

- **`cliff.toml`.** git-cliff template keyed to PointlesSQL's
  Conventional Commit scopes (`feat(ui)`, `fix(ui)`,
  `build(packaging)`, `docs(roadmap)`, `fix(alembic)`, …). Drives
  the release-notes body in `release.yml`.
- **`scripts/bump-version.sh`.** Single-`pyproject.toml` variant
  of soyuz-catalog's Sprint 19 bump-script. Guards: PEP 440
  syntax, clean tracked-file tree, on-main, tag-not-exists. In-
  place version bump, `uv lock`, anchored `[Unreleased]` →
  `[X.Y.Z] - <date>` flip in CHANGELOG.md (hand-written prose
  preserved verbatim), `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` commit, annotated
  tag. Does not push.
- **`.github/workflows/test.yml`.** First CI this repo has had.
  Jobs: ruff, pyright, pydoclint (Google), `alembic check`.
  Pytest stays out per the standing sprint-gate discipline.
  Private soyuz-catalog git-dep pulled via a `SOYUZ_READ_TOKEN`
  org-secret URL rewrite.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`.** On-tag `v*`. Runs the
  gate, `uv build`s the wheel + sdist, asserts the wheel carries
  `pointlessql/_frontend/` (force-included) and
  `pointlessql/alembic/versions/`, generates release-notes via
  `uvx git-cliff --latest --strip all`, and `gh release create`s
  with `--prerelease` auto-toggled on PEP 440 `rc*` / `a*` / `b*`
  / `dev*` shapes.

### Fixed (pre-Sprint-39 cleanup)

- **Alembic autogen drift.** `uv run alembic check` had been
  flagging six `remove_index` operations + one `add_constraint`
  on every run — the indexes were declared in migrations
  001/002/003/004/006 but never mirrored into the ORM models, so
  autogen wanted to drop them on every comparison. Declared each
  index in the owning model's `__table_args__`, including the
  partial unique `ix_users_oidc_identity`
  (`WHERE oidc_provider IS NOT NULL`) via dialect-specific
  `sqlite_where=` / `postgresql_where=` kwargs. No migration
  written — this is a model-side fix for latent drift; nothing
  in the database changes. Gate now green, so the new alembic-
  check CI step lands on solid ground.

### Changed (Sprint 38)

- **`pyproject.toml`.** `[tool.uv.sources]` swapped from an
  editable path dep (`../soyuz-catalog/soyuz-catalog-client`) to a
  private-repo git-tag pin
  (`git = "https://github.com/FloHofstetter/soyuz-catalog", tag = "v0.2.0rc2", subdirectory = "soyuz-catalog-client"`).
  First sprint where `git clone && uv sync` works on a clean
  host without a sibling `../soyuz-catalog` checkout.
- **`uv.lock`.** Regenerated against the git pin; the client is
  resolved from
  `source = { git = "…?subdirectory=soyuz-catalog-client&tag=v0.2.0rc2#<sha>" }`.
- **`Dockerfile`.** Collapsed from 3 stages to 2. The
  `soyuz-client-builder` stage and the sed-strip on
  `[tool.uv.sources]` are gone. The remaining builder stage
  fetches the client wheel over git via BuildKit
  `--mount=type=ssh`, reusing the contributor's ssh-agent. Sprint
  40 will replace this with GHCR image pulls and
  `--secret`-based `GH_TOKEN` auth.
- **`docker-compose.yml`.** `additional_contexts.soyuz-catalog`
  (only fed the now-removed Stage 1) replaced with
  `build.ssh: [default]` so `docker compose build` forwards
  ssh-agent to BuildKit. Invoke with
  `docker compose build --ssh default pointlessql`.
- **`CLAUDE.md`.** "Wiring soyuz-catalog" section rewritten.
  Default clean-machine flow documented first; the editable
  escape hatch (drop a gitignored `uv.toml` at repo root with
  `[sources] soyuz-catalog-client = { path = …, editable = true }`)
  documented second. Docker `--ssh default` requirement called
  out with a Sprint 40 forward-reference.
- **`.gitignore`.** `uv.toml` added so contributors' editable
  overrides never land in commits.

### Added (Sprint 37)

- Phase 10 (Packaging & private distribution) opened in
  [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). Distribution contract locked in as
  private GitHub tags over `[tool.uv.sources]` git-subdirectory
  pins; no public PyPI.
- Sprint 37 — forward-pulled soyuz-catalog Sprint 19 release
  engineering. Lands in the sibling repo `../soyuz-catalog/` at
  commit `be9c5c6`: `cliff.toml`, `scripts/bump-version.sh`
  (lockstep version bump + CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` flip +
  annotated tag, does not push), and
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` (on-tag; runs the existing
  `check_client_drift.sh` gate, builds server + client wheels +
  sdists, attaches all four to the GitHub Release with git-cliff
  release notes).
- First tag cut in soyuz-catalog: `v0.2.0-rc1`. Sprint 38 will
  pin PointlesSQL's `soyuz-catalog-client` source against it,
  retiring the editable path-dep that currently blocks
  clean-machine `uv sync`.

### Added (Sprint 36)

- New `frontend/js/api.js` exposes `window.pqlApi.fetch(url, init)`
  returning `{ok, status, data, error}` and auto-emitting a
  `window.pqlToast.error(...)` on non-ok responses (opt out with
  `init.silent = true`). Soyuz error bodies have their `detail` /
  `message` / `error` field extracted; network failures report
  `status: 0`. Also exposes `pqlApi.reloadWithToast(message, opts)`
  for the toast-then-reload pattern (400 ms default delay).
- Migrated five Alpine components off their hand-rolled
  `fetch` + try/catch/error-string blocks onto `pqlApi.fetch`:
  `editable`, `properties_editor`, `tags_editor`, `permissions_editor`
  (including the `silent: true` effective-permissions background
  GET), and the four `federation.js` create/delete forms. The
  inline `this.error` hints stay; the toast fires on top so
  mutations fail loudly instead of burying the error in a tiny
  red span.
- Replaced every silent `window.location.reload()` after a
  mutation with `pqlApi.reloadWithToast(...)` — `job_row_actions`,
  `/jobs` create modal, `/jobs/{id}` run/pause/resume, the
  `/dashboards/{slug}` Refresh button, and the `sync_history_card`
  Sync-now button each surface a success/info toast before the
  400 ms reload.
- Expanded the Sprint-31 command-palette Alpine component into a
  keyboard-shortcut registry. The hard-coded help-modal `<dl>` now
  iterates a `shortcuts` array with `{keys, combiner, label}`
  entries. New bindings: `g h` / `g j` / `g d` Vim-style chords
  (go home / jobs / dashboards) with a 1 s pending window; `r`
  reloads the current list page when `<body data-pql-refresh="1">`
  is set. Editable-target and modifier guards match the existing
  `?` handler.
- Plumbed `list_page: True` through the five list-route template
  contexts (`/jobs`, `/dashboards`, `/connections`,
  `/external-locations`, `/credentials`); `base.html` renders
  `data-pql-refresh="1"` on the `<body>` when the flag is set, so
  `r`-to-refresh opts in without touching each page template.
- Global `:focus-visible` rule in `style.css` gives every
  focusable element the same 2 px accent outline. The Sprint-33
  `.pql-sortable:focus-visible` rule is kept for its tighter
  offset. A new `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block
  zeroes the `--pql-duration-*` tokens and forces
  `animation-duration: 0ms` + `transition-duration: 0ms` on
  every element so Bootstrap fades, Alpine x-transitions, and
  the offcanvas slide all respect the user preference.
- New playbook `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/ux-overhaul.md` covering
  shortcut chords, the toast flow (error → red toast, success →
  toast-then-reload), focus rings, and the reduced-motion branch.

### Added (Sprint 35)

- Breakpoint tokens `--pql-breakpoint-sm/md/lg/xl` (640 / 768 /
  1024 / 1280 px) added to the Sprint-29 token block. Reference
  values only — CSS `@media` rules cannot consume `var()`, so
  every media query in `style.css` repeats the literal; the token
  block is the canonical contract, documented in
  `docs/design-tokens.md`.
- `components/nav_links.html` extracts the inline base.html
  `<ul class="navbar-nav">` so the same link set renders in the
  top navbar at `>=640 px` and again as a "Navigation" footer
  inside the existing `offcanvas-md` sidebar drawer at `<640 px`.
  One hamburger, not two — the scope's separate `<640 px`
  hamburger was merged into the existing sidebar toggle.
- `listTable()` gains a `mobileSort: boolean` config flag. When
  true, mount renders a `.pql-list-sort-mobile <select>`
  (hidden at `>=sm`) populated from every sortable `<th
  data-sort-key>` with asc / desc options. A new
  `_onMobileSort(raw)` method sets `sortKey` + `sortDir` in one
  pick, complementing the tri-state desktop header cycle. Wired
  up on jobs, dashboards, external-locations, and the Sprint-34
  Columns card.
- CSS-only card transform at `<640 px`: `.pql-list-table` rows
  collapse into 2-column label / value stacks, with each `<td>`'s
  `data-label="…"` rendered as an uppercase key via
  `::before`. Applied to the four `listTable()` pages plus the
  Sprint-34 Schemas / Tables / Preview / Columns cards. Row-
  action cells opt out of the key rendering (no `::before`) and
  stay right-aligned.
- `.pql-notebook-mobile-notice` banner above the Jupyter iframe
  at `<768 px` — "JupyterLab is optimised for desktop…". The
  iframe itself stays mounted; the notice is a heads-up, not a
  blocker.
- Touch-target baseline `min-height: 44px` under
  `@media (hover: none)` for buttons, links, inputs, selects,
  chips, sortable headers. Scoped to touch-only devices so
  hover-capable laptops keep the compact Sprint-33 spacing.
- New playbook `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/mobile.md` exercising
  phone (375 × 812) / tablet (768 × 1024) / desktop (1280 × 800)
  viewports via `browser_resize` + `browser_navigate`; found-
  bugs section filled in clean.

### Added (Sprint 34)

- Catalog detail page (`/catalogs/{c}`) gains an inline Schemas card.
  Populated by `client.list_schemas` folded into the existing
  `asyncio.gather`; shows name (linked to schema detail), updated,
  and comment. Per-schema table counts were dropped from the original
  scope to avoid O(N) fan-out to soyuz-catalog — `schema.updated_at`
  alone keeps the card useful without the extra round-trips.
- Schema detail page (`/catalogs/{c}/schemas/{s}`) gains an inline
  Tables card with name (linked to table detail), type, format, column
  count, updated, and comment — sourced from the existing
  `list_tables` bypass path that already returns full `TableInfo`
  payloads.
- Table detail page (`/catalogs/{c}/schemas/{s}/tables/{t}`) gains a
  Preview card. New `GET /api/catalogs/{c}/schemas/{s}/tables/{t}/preview`
  runs `PQL().table(...)` inside `asyncio.to_thread` under the
  caller's `X-Principal`, caps at 10 rows server-side (no
  client-tunable `?limit=`), emits `Cache-Control: no-store` so row
  data does not persist in the browser disk cache after a permission
  revocation, and degrades to a single-card error banner on any
  engine/Delta failure instead of 500-ing the page. Engine-agnostic
  via a `_preview_head` helper that keeps DuckDB lazy
  (`rel.limit(n).df()`) and coerces polars through `to_pandas()`.
  Values flow through `fastapi.encoders.jsonable_encoder` so Decimal,
  datetime, bytes, and numpy scalars serialise cleanly.
- Columns table on the table detail page gains client-side search +
  sort via Sprint-33 `listTable()` when `columns|length >= 20`.
  Sortable keys: position, name, type, nullable. Below the threshold
  the table stays server-rendered unchanged (progressive enhancement).
- Lineage card (`components/lineage_card.html`) now groups upstream
  and downstream nodes by depth under per-depth subheadings
  ("Depth 1", "Depth 2", …) instead of a flat `sort(depth)` list
  with padding-left indent. The per-node depth badge stays —
  redundant-but-defensive survives a future collapse/filter. Node
  links (3-part `catalog.schema.table` names → table detail) were
  already present from an earlier sprint and are unchanged.
- "Open in notebook" button on the PQL snippet card (admin-only).
  New `POST /api/catalogs/{c}/schemas/{s}/tables/{t}/open-in-notebook`
  sanitises identifiers with `re.sub(r"[^A-Za-z0-9_-]", "_", …)`,
  appends `secrets.token_hex(3)` to defeat double-click filename
  collisions, writes an `nbformat.v4` notebook (markdown header +
  a `pql.table(...)`-pre-filled code cell) to
  `{notebooks_dir}/scratch/…`, re-validates the path via
  `resolve_upload_target` to block traversal escapes, and returns a
  `lab_url` the Alpine handler navigates to with
  `window.location.assign`. Writes an `open_in_notebook` audit entry.
- `notebook_workspace` skip-list extended: `scratch/` joins `runs/`
  as a top-level directory excluded from `list_workspace_tree` so
  machine-generated scratch notebooks never pollute the
  user-authored workspace view. Skip logic rewritten to match by
  name against a `_SKIP_TOP_LEVEL_DIRS` frozenset scoped to the
  notebooks root — same behaviour as before for `runs/`, adds
  `scratch/` without duplicating the absolute-path equality check.

### Added (Sprint 33)

- Shared `frontend/js/list_table.js` — `window.listTable(config)`
  Alpine factory that adds debounced (150 ms) client-side search,
  sortable column headers (asc → desc → none, driven by `aria-sort`
  + a CSS pseudo-element arrow so no className juggling is required),
  and optional filter chips on top of any Bootstrap `<table>` whose
  rows carry `data-search` + `data-sort-<key>` attributes.
  Progressive enhancement — rows stay rendered server-side and the
  page is still usable if JS never runs.
- Applied `listTable` to `/jobs`, `/dashboards`, `/connections`,
  `/credentials`, `/external-locations`. Chips configured per page:
  `Paused` + `Last run failed` on jobs, `Has bound job` on
  dashboards, one chip per distinct `connection_type` on
  connections, one chip per distinct `purpose` on credentials,
  none on external-locations.
- `frontend/js/humanize_cron.js` — `window.pqlHumanizeCron(expr)`
  turns the common 5-field cron shapes + the six `@`-macros into
  human-readable strings ("Daily at 00:00", "Weekly on Monday at
  08:30"), falls back to the raw expression for anything the helper
  doesn't recognise. Applied on the `/jobs` list Cron cell and the
  `/jobs/{id}` detail Configuration card; the cell's `title`
  attribute still shows the raw expression for hover tooltips.
- `frontend/js/relative_time.js` — extracted the Sprint 32 inline
  `window.pqlRelativeTime` helper into its own file so the
  `/jobs` "last run" column can reuse it without duplicating code.
  `home.html`'s local copy is now a one-line pointer comment; the
  helper's behaviour is unchanged.
- `GET /api/jobs` now emits `last_run_status`, `last_run_at` and
  `last_run_duration_s` per job. Populated by a new
  `_latest_run_per_job(session, job_ids)` helper that fetches the
  latest run per job in one round-trip via a `group_by(job_id)` +
  `max(started_at)` subquery, portable across SQLite and Postgres
  and riding the existing `(job_id, started_at)` index on
  `JobRun`. The same map also feeds the server-rendered `/jobs`
  row rendering.
- `/jobs` rows gain a "Last run" column — a
  `.pql-status-dot--{status}` + `pqlRelativeTime(iso)` pair
  mirroring the home dashboard's latest-runs table. Rows with no
  runs yet show `—`.
- Hover quick-actions on `/jobs` rows (admin-only) — a trailing
  `<td class="pql-row-actions">` whose buttons are revealed on
  `tr:hover` and `tr:focus-within` (always visible on touch
  devices via `@media (hover: none)`). "Run now" POSTs to the
  existing `/api/jobs/{id}/run`; "Pause" / "Resume" POSTs to
  `/pause` or `/unpause`. Both fire through `window.pqlToast` for
  the success/error banner and reload 400 ms later, matching the
  Sprint-36-direction already established by Sprint 32.
- `frontend/js/job_row_actions.js` — `window.jobRowActions({jobId,
  paused})` Alpine factory backing the new row-action buttons.
- CSS additions in `frontend/css/style.css`: `.pql-list-controls`,
  `.pql-chip` + `.pql-chip--active`, `.pql-sortable` with arrow
  pseudo-element, `.pql-row-actions` with hover/focus-within
  reveal.
- `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/list-polish.md` — Playwright MCP playbook
  covering search debounce, sortable cycle, chip AND-ing, cron
  humanization + raw-title tooltip, last-run column rendering,
  hover-reveal + toast-then-reload on Run-now / Pause, the
  non-admin column gating, the four other flat list pages, the
  `/api/jobs` JSON shape, and a Sprint-32 relative-time
  regression check.

### Added (Sprint 32)

- Home dashboard — the `/` route (formerly the welcome hero in
  `pages/catalogs.html`) is now a real dashboard. Welcome header,
  7-day success-rate sparkline (inline SVG, no Chart.js),
  10 most-recent job runs with status dots, a Recent catalogs card
  driven by `localStorage['pql.recentCatalogs']`, Your-dashboards
  card (owner-scoped), and a Quick actions cluster that keeps the
  admin-only "Create foreign catalog" modal reachable.
- 3-step onboarding checklist empty-state — shown only when the
  current user has no visible catalogs, no jobs, and no dashboards;
  suppressed when soyuz is unavailable so users whose data is fine
  are not told to "connect a data source". Admin gets the inline
  Create-foreign-catalog button; non-admin sees an
  "ask an admin" hint.
- `GET /api/home/summary` — one round-trip for every server-side
  card. Returns `{user, catalogs, jobs, dashboards, latest_runs,
  sparkline, onboarding}`. Soyuz `list_catalogs()` runs in parallel
  with the local DB work via `asyncio.gather` + `asyncio.to_thread`;
  a `CatalogUnavailableError` downgrades to `catalogs.unavailable =
  true` with a 200 response so the page still renders every local
  card. Visibility mirrors `/api/jobs` (latest_runs + sparkline
  filter `Job.run_as_user_id == user.id` for non-admins).
- Catalog-visit instrumentation in `base.html` — any page that
  threads `active_catalog` (catalog/schema/table detail) writes
  `{name, ts}` into `localStorage['pql.recentCatalogs']`, deduped
  by name, capped at 5. Pattern mirrors the Sprint-31 palette's
  `pql.recentSearches` writer.
- Sparkline CSS in `frontend/css/style.css` uses three semantic
  tints (`--pql-color-success-fg` / `--pql-color-warning-fg` /
  `--pql-color-danger-fg`) plus a neutral empty-day style, so the
  prepared light-mode variant comes for free. Bars have a 2 px
  floor and a nested `<title>` tooltip for native hover.
- `.pql-status-dot--{succeeded,failed,running,pending,skipped}` —
  compact status indicators reused by the latest-runs table.
- `pages/home.html` + `components/create_foreign_catalog_modal.html`
  (extracted from the old welcome page; the modal markup itself is
  unchanged). `pages/catalogs.html` deleted — `/` was its only
  caller. The Sprint-22 `catalog-browsing.md` playbook's step 1 was
  updated to assert the new Quick actions counter instead of the
  old `N catalogs available` pill.
- `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/home.md` — Playwright MCP playbook
  covering the twelve home-page assertions including the soyuz-down
  degradation (verified 200 + `catalogs.unavailable=true` + banner +
  local cards still render), the visit-tracking instrumentation,
  and the system-empty onboarding trigger.

### Fixed (Sprint 32, same-commit from playbook replay)

- **BUG-32-01**: the sparkline SVG didn't render because Alpine's
  `<template x-for>` inside `<svg>` fails — `<template>.content`
  is an HTML-namespaced DocumentFragment, so inner `<rect>` elements
  were parsed as unknown HTML and never bound. Surfaced as
  `ReferenceError: d is not defined` / `Document.importNode:
  Argument 1 is not an object.` in the browser console on first
  load. Fixed by computing `bar_height`, `bar_class`, and
  `bar_title` server-side in `_build_home_summary` and rendering
  the seven `<rect>`s via a plain Jinja `{% for %}` loop. The
  `homeSparkline()` Alpine factory survives only for the meta
  counters.
- **BUG-32-02**: the home-page two-column CSS Grid used
  `align-items: stretch` (the Grid default), which dehned the Job
  activity card and the Quick actions card to match whichever
  neighbour was tallest. Combined with `grid-row: 2 / span 2` on
  the Latest runs card, the Sparkline card acquired a dead lower
  half. Fixed by switching to two flex columns
  (`.pql-home-col--primary` / `--secondary`) — each card now hugs
  its natural height. Also added `justify-content: space-between`
  to `.pql-home-sparkline` so the SVG and its meta counters sit at
  opposite ends of the card header rather than clustering on the
  left.

### Added (Sprint 31)

- Global command palette — `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` opens a centred dialog
  that searches catalogs, schemas, tables, connections, credentials,
  external locations, jobs, dashboards, and (admin-only) workspace
  notebooks in one shot. Prefix matches outrank substring matches;
  ties resolve by `updated_at` descending. Empty query renders
  `localStorage['pql.recentSearches']` (last 10, deduped by URL).
  `?` opens a keyboard-shortcuts help modal.
- `GET /api/search?q=&limit=` aggregates the seven sources via
  `asyncio.gather` (reusing `unitycatalog.get_tree()`,
  `list_connections/credentials/external_locations`, the local
  `Job` / `Dashboard` ORM queries, and
  `notebook_workspace.list_workspace_tree`). Per-source soyuz
  failures degrade gracefully: a `PointlessSQLError` from one
  fetcher logs at WARNING and the remaining sources still answer,
  so a soyuz blip never 502's the palette.
- `frontend/templates/components/command_palette.html` mounted once
  in `base.html` so the shortcut is global. Alpine factory
  `commandPalette()` owns palette + help-modal state, debounces
  search to 150 ms, drops stale responses by sequence number, and
  guards `?` against firing while focus is in an input or the
  palette itself.
- Navbar gains a ghost-button trigger (`.pql-cmdk-trigger`) with a
  platform-aware `⌘K` / `Ctrl+K` keycap hint and a mobile-only
  search-icon button below 768 px. Removed the `ms-auto` from the
  navbar `<ul>` and put it on the trigger so the button anchors the
  right-hand cluster.
- Design-token-native CSS for the palette, hit list, type badges
  (one accent per source family), help modal, and `<kbd>` keycaps;
  reuses `--pql-color-*`, `--pql-elev-3`, and `--pql-radius-md`
  from Sprint 29 so light mode works for free.
- `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/command-palette.md` — Playwright MCP
  playbook covering navbar trigger, Cmd+K, keyboard nav, recent
  searches, admin/non-admin notebook visibility split, the `?`
  help modal, and the soyuz-degraded fallback.

### Added (Sprint 30)

- New app-shell layer in `base.html`: mobile-aware responsive grid
  (`minmax(0, 1fr)` below `md`, `var(--pql-sidebar-width) minmax(0, 1fr)` ≥ md),
  sidebar wrapped in Bootstrap 5.3 `offcanvas-md` with a hamburger
  trigger visible only on narrow viewports. No new JS module — Bootstrap's
  built-in offcanvas handles open/close, backdrop, and Esc-to-close.
  Sprint 35 hardens touch targets and focus-trap.
- `frontend/templates/components/breadcrumbs.html` — declarative
  component that renders from a `breadcrumbs=[{label, href?}]` list;
  the final item (or any item without `href`) becomes the active
  terminal crumb. Migrated 8 pages: `jobs`, `dashboards`, `connections`,
  `external_locations`, `credentials`, `notebooks_workspace`,
  `schemas`, `tables`.
- `frontend/templates/components/empty.html` — reusable empty-state
  panel with optional `icon`, `title`, `message`, `action_href` /
  `action_label`, and a `flush` variant for use inside an existing
  card. Migrated the 6 list-page empty states (jobs, dashboards,
  connections, external_locations, credentials, notebooks_workspace)
  — in-card snippets (permissions, tags, lineage, properties,
  sync_history) remain opportunistic follow-up.
- New branded error pages: `pages/404.html` (bi-compass), `pages/500.html`
  (bi-exclamation-octagon, renders `request_id` for bug reports),
  both on the new app shell. `pages/403.html` refitted onto the same
  `components/empty.html` primitive — preserving the existing
  `required_privilege`/`securable_type`/`full_name` context.
- `pointlessql/api/error_handlers.py` — Accept-aware dispatch:
  `/api/` paths still always emit the JSON envelope; non-`/api/` paths
  honour an explicit `Accept: application/json` without `text/html`,
  otherwise render the HTML shell. Registered a `StarletteHTTPException`
  handler so unmapped 404s render the branded page (not FastAPI's
  default JSON), and an `Exception` catch-all that logs `exc_info` and
  returns the 500 shell or JSON envelope.
- `frontend/js/toast.js` — `window.pqlToast.{success, error, info}(msg, {timeout}?)`
  mounted once in `base.html`. Each call builds a Bootstrap toast in
  `#pql-toast-root`, applies a Sprint-29 semantic variant
  (`.pql-toast--{success|error|info}`), and removes the node on
  `hidden.bs.toast`. API only this sprint; Sprint 36 wires the five
  existing components onto an `apiFetch` helper that emits toasts
  on error.
- CSS additions in `frontend/css/style.css`: responsive `.pql-shell`
  grid, `.pql-sidebar-shell` offcanvas reset, `.pql-sidebar-toggle`,
  `.pql-breadcrumbs`, `.pql-empty` (+ `.pql-empty--{variant}` tints,
  `__icon` / `__title` / `__message` / `__meta` / `__action`),
  `.pql-error-shell` centered wrapper, and `.pql-toast` (+ variants).
  All colour pairs reuse Sprint-29 semantic tokens so light-mode
  inherits for free.

### Added (Sprint 29)

- Design-token system in `frontend/css/style.css`: spacing
  (`--pql-space-1..8`, 4-px scale), typography
  (`--pql-text-xs..3xl`, ~1.125 modular ratio), radius
  (`--pql-radius-sm|md|lg|pill`), elevation (`--pql-elev-0..3`,
  dark-mode-tuned), motion (`--pql-duration-fast|normal|slow` +
  `--pql-ease`), and semantic colour pairs (success / warning /
  danger / info / neutral — each with a `bg` + `fg` variable so
  chip text meets AA contrast against its own background). Brand
  accent `#76b900` preserved as `--pql-color-accent`
- Light-mode variant **prepared** via a
  `:root[data-bs-theme="light"]` override block — tokens flip
  automatically when the attribute changes. No toggle is wired
  yet; switching in DevTools is enough to verify downstream
  primitives adapt
- Inter font self-hosted (OFL-1.1, Latin subset) at
  `frontend/fonts/inter-regular.woff2` (23.7 kB) and
  `inter-semibold.woff2` (24.3 kB) — combined 48 kB, under the
  50 kB per-page budget. Two `@font-face` blocks with
  `font-display: swap`; `body { font-family: var(--pql-font-sans); }`
  picks it up globally. Regular is `<link rel="preload">`-ed in
  `base.html`; SemiBold is lazy-loaded on first use
- CSS-only primitives: `.pql-stack` (vertical flex with token
  gap; `--tight`/`--loose` modifiers), `.pql-cluster`
  (horizontal wrapping cluster), `.pql-card` (panel surface
  replacing the 18-site `card mb-4 p-4` pattern; sibling
  `.pql-card + .pql-card` auto-margins; `.pql-card--flush`
  strips padding for iframe wrappers), `.pql-badge` (pill-shaped
  status chip, semantic-palette modifiers `--success|warning|danger|info`)
- Proof-of-concept template migrations: `base.html` (font
  preload + Inter via body rule), `pages/login.html` (card ↦
  `.pql-card` + nested `.pql-stack` form layout), and
  `pages/catalogs.html` (welcome hero wrapped in `.pql-card` +
  `.pql-stack --loose`; catalog-count chip becomes
  `.pql-badge --info`). The remaining 27 templates stay on
  Bootstrap utilities and will migrate in Sprints 30 / 33 / 34
  as those sprints touch each surface
- `docs/design-tokens.md` reference — token tables with
  "when to use" notes, primitive snippets, light-mode override
  pattern, and contribution conventions (new tokens land
  alongside a doc update in the same commit)

### Added (Sprint 28)

- Alembic migration `008_dashboards.py` creating the
  `dashboards` table (slug unique, title, description,
  notebook_path, job_id FK nullable with `ON DELETE SET NULL`,
  owner_id FK, timestamps)
- New `Dashboard` ORM model in `pointlessql/models.py`
- `render_run_notebook` in `pointlessql/services/notebook_render.py`
  gains an `exclude_input: bool = False` keyword; when true,
  renders with `HTMLExporter(..., exclude_input=True)` and caches
  to a sibling `{run_id}.dashboard.html` sidecar so the
  code-visible and code-hidden variants coexist without clobbering
  each other
- `GET /jobs/{id}/runs/{rid}/notebook` gains an optional
  `?exclude_input=true` query param threaded through to the
  render helper
- Dashboard CRUD routes: `GET /api/dashboards` (list, any
  logged-in user), `GET /api/dashboards/tree` (sidebar shape),
  `POST /api/dashboards` (admin-only, validates slug against
  `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,199}$`), `PATCH /api/dashboards/{slug}`
  (admin-only; editable fields: title, description,
  notebook_path, job_id), `DELETE /api/dashboards/{slug}`
  (admin-only), `POST /api/dashboards/{slug}/refresh`
  (admin-only; triggers the bound job's `execute_run(...,
  trigger="manual")` via the same helper that powers the
  job-detail Run-now button)
- `GET /dashboards` list page + `GET /dashboards/{slug}` detail
  page rendering the latest succeeded run through an iframe
  pointed at `/jobs/.../notebook?exclude_input=true`; empty
  state when no job is bound or no successful run exists
- `GET /jobs/{id}/runs/{rid}/compare?to={other_rid}` — two
  Sprint-26 iframes side-by-side with run metadata headers; both
  run ids are validated to belong to the same job before render
  (no foreign-run leak). No cell-level diff highlighting (stub)
- "Compare runs" card on `pages/job_detail.html` (visible only
  when ≥ 2 completed runs exist) with two `<select>`s and a
  Compare button that navigates to the compare URL
- New templates: `pages/dashboards.html`,
  `pages/dashboard_detail.html`, `pages/run_compare.html`, and
  `components/dashboards_sidebar.html` (mirrors the Sprint 27
  workspace-tree component; `sessionStorage` key
  `pql.dashboards`)
- Navbar gains a **Dashboards** link (visible to every logged-in
  user — consumer surface, not admin-only); `base.html` swaps in
  the dashboards sidebar when `active_page == 'dashboards'`
- New playbook `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/dashboards.md` covering
  create-modal → detail with code-hidden iframe → Refresh →
  sidebar tree → non-admin visibility → run-compare from the
  job-detail card, plus the foreign-run 404 negative

### Added (Sprint 27)

- New `pointlessql/services/notebook_workspace.py` with
  `list_workspace_tree(notebooks_dir)` (nested listing with per-
  notebook `parameters_tagged: bool`; skips the executor `runs/`
  subdir) and `resolve_upload_target(notebooks_dir, relative_path)`
  (mirrors `resolve_notebook_path` but allows a not-yet-existing
  target and requires the parent directory to exist)
- `GET /api/notebooks/tree` — admin-only directory listing for
  the workspace browser
- `POST /api/notebooks/upload` — admin-only multipart upload of
  `.ipynb` files into the notebooks workspace; validates
  `.ipynb` extension, parses the body as JSON before writing,
  atomically replaces via a `.tmp` sidecar, and requires an
  explicit `overwrite=true` form field to clobber an existing
  file
- `GET /notebooks/workspace` — new admin-only HTML page with a
  flattened-tree component keyed on `sessionStorage`
  `pql.notebooks` / `pql.notebooks.open`, plus a per-leaf
  **Schedule…** button that navigates to
  `/jobs?prefill_kind=papermill&prefill_notebook_path=<path>`
- Create-job modal (`pages/jobs.html`) reads those query params
  on mount, pre-fills `kind=papermill` + `notebookPath`, chains
  `inspect()` for the typed-parameters form, opens the modal,
  and strips the query string via `history.replaceState`
- Navbar gains a **Workspace** link (admin-only) between
  Notebook and Jobs
- Playbook extension: Part G in
  `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-jobs.md` covers upload →
  schedule → run-now → Output artifacts card, plus non-admin
  403 and the overwrite / traversal / non-`.ipynb` negative paths

### Added (Sprint 26)

- `nbconvert>=7.0` dep and new `pointlessql/services/notebook_render.py`
  with `render_run_notebook(runs_dir, run_id)` — first call runs
  `HTMLExporter(template_name="lab")` on
  `runs/{run_id}.ipynb`, writes an atomic `.html` sidecar next to
  it, and returns the HTML; subsequent calls serve the sidecar
- `GET /jobs/{id}/runs/{rid}/notebook` — inline-renders a
  papermill run's output notebook for iframe embedding on the
  job-detail page
- `GET /jobs/{id}/runs/{rid}/notebook/download?format={ipynb,html}`
  — visibility-checked downloads of the raw notebook or its
  rendered sidecar. Replaces the originally planned
  `/notebooks/runs/` StaticFiles mount so non-owner logged-in
  users can't exfiltrate other users' run outputs by guessing
  `run_id`s. Both routes share `_load_papermill_run_output_path`
  which validates job ownership, papermill kind, and run
  ownership before touching disk
- New "Output artifacts" card on `job_detail.html` (between
  the DAG tasks and Recent runs cards, guarded by
  `job.kind == "papermill"`): auto-selects the most recent
  succeeded/failed run on page load, Rendered/JupyterLab view
  toggle wired to the two iframe sources, download links for
  `.ipynb` and `.html`
- Recent runs rows are now clickable on papermill jobs;
  `$dispatch("run-selected", { runId })` swaps the card's
  iframe to the clicked run's output. The Sprint 24 "Open in
  JupyterLab" anchor retains `@click.stop` so row-click and
  popout-click don't collide
- `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-jobs.md` Part F walks the
  card's auto-select, view-toggle, row-click swap, downloads,
  and the three 404 negatives

### Added (Sprint 25)

- `GET /api/notebooks/inspect?path=…` admin-only route wrapping
  `papermill.inspect_notebook` — returns
  `[{name, default, inferred_type, help}]` so the create-job modal
  can render one typed input per declared parameter instead of a
  free-form JSON textarea
- Create-job modal gains a "Load parameters" button, a typed form
  (`number` / `checkbox` / `text` / `textarea`) rendered via Alpine
  `x-for`, and a collapsed `<details>` "Advanced" fallback that
  keeps the raw JSON textarea for power users. Advanced mode wins
  over the typed form when the `useAdvanced` checkbox is ticked
- Job-detail Configuration card renders dedicated **Notebook** and
  **Parameters** rows for papermill jobs (nested `<dl>` for the
  parameters) instead of the catch-all `<pre>{{ config|tojson }}</pre>`
- Promoted `_resolve_notebook_path` → public `resolve_notebook_path`
  in `services/scheduler.py` so the inspect route reuses the same
  traversal-safe path resolver the executor uses
- Seed script writes `notebooks/smoke_typed_params.ipynb`
  (`count: int = 3`, `enabled: bool = True`, `label: str = "hello"`)
  for the new Part E playbook — one parameter per typed-input branch
- `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-jobs.md` Part E walks the
  inspect endpoint, the typed-form rendering + override, the
  Advanced raw-JSON fallback, and two negative inspect cases
  (missing file, traversal). Live-run findings appended to the
  Found-bugs section — no bugs surfaced

### Added (Sprint 24)

- Papermill job kind: `_papermill_executor` registered next to
  `pg_sync` and `python` in `scheduler_service.build_default_registry()`.
  Config shape `{notebook_path, parameters, timeout_seconds}`;
  output lands at `{notebooks_dir}/runs/{job_run_id}.ipynb` so the
  embedded JupyterLab serves it at `/lab/tree/runs/{run_id}.ipynb`
- `POINTLESSQL_PRINCIPAL` env var honoured by the `PQL` constructor
  (via `make_principal_client`) so notebook code running under the
  Papermill executor inherits the job's run-as user without extra
  wiring — the scheduler exports the env var into the kernel
  subprocess
- New settings `POINTLESSQL_NOTEBOOKS_DIR` (default `notebooks`) and
  `POINTLESSQL_NOTEBOOK_EXECUTE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default `300`).
  `services/jupyter.py` now resolves its `--notebook-dir` through
  the setting so the executor and the embedded JupyterLab share a
  single source of truth
- Create-job modal (`frontend/templates/pages/jobs.html`) gains a
  `kind` select with `DAG (multi-task)` and `Papermill (single
  notebook)` options; Papermill-specific `notebook_path` +
  `parameters` inputs render conditionally
- Job detail page (`frontend/templates/pages/job_detail.html`)
  recent-runs table gains a trailing "Open in JupyterLab" column
  on rows of `kind=papermill` jobs whose run status is `succeeded`
  or `failed`
- `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/notebook-jobs.md` — Phase-8 playbook
  covering create via modal, Run-now, output-artifact verification,
  the JupyterLab deep-link, and four negative paths
  (missing path, traversal, missing file, failing cell)

### Added (Sprint 23)

- `docker-compose.e2e.yml` gains a `mock-oidc` service
  (`ghcr.io/navikt/mock-oauth2-server:latest`, host port 9090)
  and `${…:-default}` env passthroughs on the `pointlessql`
  service for `POINTLESSQL_SCHEDULER_TICK_SECONDS`
  (default `2` so DAG state transitions land in seconds during
  live walks), `POINTLESSQL_JUPYTER_ENABLED`,
  `POINTLESSQL_LOG_FORMAT`, and the four `POINTLESSQL_OIDC_*`
  / `POINTLESSQL_BASE_URL` knobs. All default to empty so the
  Sprint 22 data-surface playbooks keep working unchanged
- Five orchestration + operational playbooks under
  `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/`:
  - `jobs-dag.md` — single-task + DAG job creation, Run-now,
    retry + fail-skip propagation, Pause/Resume click, per-task
    log panel expand, and a `pg_sync`-kind cross-feature smoke
    driving Sprint 18's `run_sync()` against the Sprint 22
    `pg_mirror` foreign catalog
  - `notebook.md` — `/notebook` + `/api/jupyter/status` in
    `jupyter_enabled=true` (iframe src `http://localhost:8888/lab`,
    Alpine `jupyterLoader().ready` flips to true) and `=false`
    (template short-circuits to "Notebook Disabled" card) passes
  - `oidc.md` — SSO button absent with no OIDC env, then with
    the mock issuer a full authorize-code + PKCE round-trip that
    auto-creates a user with `oidc_provider` / `oidc_subject`
    bound; repeated sign-in reuses the existing row
  - `operational.md` — anonymous `/healthz`, admin `/metrics`
    `text/plain` with all three metric families, non-admin
    `/metrics` renders 403, JSON API errors carry a UUID
    `request_id`, `X-Request-ID` round-trips client-supplied
    values
  - `config-matrix.md` — primary walk (`engine=pandas,
    log=text, db=sqlite`) plus five delta walks for every
    non-default value of `POINTLESSQL_ENGINE`,
    `POINTLESSQL_LOG_FORMAT`, `POINTLESSQL_DATABASE_URL`, and
    their cartesian-product smoke
- `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/README.md` updated: cross-links to the
  ten playbooks, the host-env overlay table with the
  recreate-pointlessql workflow, and a Sprint-23 section on the
  `mock-oidc` + bridge-IP workaround for Docker DNS asymmetry
- `CLAUDE.md` "Replaying the e2e walkthroughs" section pinning
  the ten-playbook tree, the `--browser firefox` /
  `chrome-for-testing` MCP config requirement (Sprint 22 commit
  `3f1da76` backstory), and the "replay before landing HTML/JS"
  contract for future sprints
- Phase 7 close-out summary appended to `ROADMAP.md`: all five
  surfaced bugs fixed same-commit, none deferred

### Fixed (Sprint 23)

- **BUG-23-01**: `oidc_enabled` computed property in
  `pointlessql/settings.py` used `is not None`, treating the
  empty strings produced by the compose overlay's
  `${POINTLESSQL_OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL:-}` fallback as
  *configured*. The SSO button on `/auth/login` rendered and
  clicking it hit a `401 Failed to fetch OIDC discovery
  document`. Truthy check replaces the `is not None` so both
  `None` and `""` count as "not configured"
- **BUG-23-02**: `POST /api/jobs` in `pointlessql/api/main.py`
  committed the `Job` row before running
  `scheduler_service.validate_dag` over the task list, so a
  cycle / unknown-dep payload returned 422 but left the job row
  visible on `/jobs` forever. Refactored to `session.flush()`
  during the two-pass task insert and a single final
  `session.commit()` only after `validate_dag` succeeds —
  rejected payloads roll back cleanly when the session context
  exits

### Added (Sprint 22)

- `docker-compose.e2e.yml` overlay — `postgres-e2e` sidecar
  (postgres:17-alpine, port 5433) seeded from
  `scripts/pg-seed.sql` as the foreign-catalog target for the
  sync playbook; mounts `./scripts:/app/scripts:ro` on the
  `pointlessql` service so the seed script can run server-side
  with consistent `file:///app/warehouse/...` storage URIs
- `scripts/pg-seed.sql` — defensively idempotent Postgres
  `shop` schema (customers, products, orders) with a few seeded
  rows so the first foreign-catalog sync returns `added_count`
  equal to `schema + 3 tables`
- `scripts/seed-e2e.py` — idempotent driver that runs inside
  the PointlesSQL container: creates managed catalog `demo`,
  schemas `demo.sales` / `demo.hr` with `file://` storage
  roots, writes four Delta tables via `PQL.write_table` (50
  orders, 20 customers, 10 employees, 10 salaries), and
  registers a soyuz `Connection pg_e2e` pre-bound to the
  seeded Postgres so the foreign-catalog create modal picks it
  up without further setup
- `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/README.md` — operator doc: stack
  start/teardown, test-user credentials shared across playbooks,
  how Claude replays a playbook via the Playwright MCP tool set,
  selector conventions for a codebase without `data-test`
  attributes, rebuild note for stale cached container images
- Five Markdown playbooks under `docs/e2e-walkthroughs/`:
  `auth.md` (first-user admin bootstrap + non-admin + `/auth/me`
  + `/metrics` 403), `catalog-browsing.md` (welcome screen +
  sidebar-tree sessionStorage persistence + PQL-snippet copy
  button), `inline-editors.md` (`editable` +
  `properties_editor` + `tags_editor` + `permissions_card`
  grant/revoke across catalog/schema/table, driven via
  `Alpine.$data(card)` rather than DOM mutation so Alpine's
  reactive bindings don't swallow typed values), `federation.md`
  (admin CRUD of connections / credentials / external locations
  with `deleteConfirm`, non-admin 403 negative), and
  `foreign-catalog-sync.md` (create-foreign-catalog modal → Sync
  now → sync-history card → mirrored `pg_mirror.shop.*`
  tables in the sidebar)
- All five playbooks exercised live via Playwright MCP in
  Firefox against a freshly-composed stack. Playbooks record
  what each step's `browser_evaluate` returned so the next
  replay has a concrete expectation. Three bugs surfaced
  during the live run and were fixed in the same sprint:
  - **BUG-22-01 fixed**: `_wrap_catalog_errors` in
    `pointlessql/services/unitycatalog.py` now branches on
    `UnexpectedStatus.status_code` — 404 → `CatalogNotFoundError`,
    other 4xx → `ValidationError`, only 5xx / transport →
    `CatalogUnavailableError`. PATCH permissions with an
    invalid privilege (e.g. `SELECT` at catalog level) now
    returns `422 validation_error` passing the soyuz message
    through; PATCH on a non-existent catalog now returns
    `404 catalog_not_found`
  - **BUG-22-02 fixed**: the same decorator now catches
    `KeyError` / `TypeError` raised by a generated
    `Create*.from_dict()` (missing required request-body field)
    and re-raises `ValidationError`. `POST
    /api/external-locations` without `credential_name` now
    returns `422 validation_error: "Invalid request body:
    'credential_name'"` instead of a 500 leaking the KeyError
  - **BUG-22-03 fixed**:
    `createExternalLocationForm.submit()` in
    `frontend/js/federation.js` now rejects an empty
    `credentialName` with an inline error before issuing the
    request, matching the UC spec requirement surfaced by
    BUG-22-02

### Added (Sprint 21)

- `pointlessql/services/metrics.py` — Prometheus surface on its
  own `CollectorRegistry` so tests don't contaminate the global
  default. `Counter pointlessql_job_runs_total{status,job_name}`,
  `Histogram pointlessql_job_run_duration_seconds{job_name}`
  (buckets 0.05 s .. 3600 s, log-spaced, includes the Prom
  default 10 s), `Gauge pointlessql_scheduler_tick_lag_seconds`;
  `render_metrics()` / `record_run()` / `observe_tick_lag()`
  helpers
- `GET /metrics` admin-only (raises `AuthorizationError` via
  `_require_admin`); returns `generate_latest()` bytes with
  `text/plain; version=0.0.4`
- Optional per-job failure webhook: `jobs.on_failure_url`
  (Alembic migration 007, nullable `String(1000)`). Scheduler
  POSTs `{job_id, job_name, run_id, status, error, started_at,
  finished_at}` (ISO-8601) on a failed run via
  `_post_failure_webhook`. 5 s timeout, no retries, one-shot
  `httpx.AsyncClient.post`; `httpx.HTTPError` logged at WARN
  and swallowed so a broken receiver never affects run state.
  `_webhook_client_factory` exposed for test stubbing
- `docs/jobs.md` — authoring guide: executor signature
  (`job_run_id, user_info, config, uc_client`), publishing a
  custom kind via the `pointlessql.jobs` entry-point group, the
  scheduling JSON + `on_failure_url` payload shape, a worked
  `pql`-in-a-task summary-table example, notes on logging /
  retries / concurrency, observability, and when to add a
  built-in kind instead
- README.md gains a "Jobs" section linking to `docs/jobs.md`
- `tests/test_metrics.py` — 9 new tests (emission on success +
  failure, `/metrics` admin-only enforcement, webhook URL +
  payload keys + timeout, no-webhook path, broken-receiver
  does not abort the run). Sprint 19+20 scheduler tests still
  green (36 passed). Full suite not run in this sprint

### Changed (Sprint 21)

- `scheduler.py`: `execute_run` wraps a new `_execute_run_core`
  and emits telemetry around every run; `tick_once` emits
  telemetry for synthetic `skipped` rows too; `Scheduler._run`
  samples tick lag each iteration

### Added (Sprint 20)

- Alembic migration 006: `jobs.max_parallel_runs`; `job_tasks`
  gains `kind`, `depends_on` (JSON list of task ids),
  `max_retries`, `retry_backoff_seconds`; new `task_runs`
  (id, job_run_id FK, task_id FK, status, started_at,
  finished_at, attempts, error); `job_logs.task_id` nullable
  FK (batch-alter safe on SQLite)
- Topological DAG walk in `scheduler.py`: iterative three-color
  DFS validates the graph at create-time and raises
  `ValidationError("cycle detected in task graph: [...]")`
  with the offending path; unknown `depends_on` ids caught
  in the pre-pass; upstream-fail → downstream tasks marked
  `skipped` (not `failed`)
- Retry policy per task: linear backoff (delay between
  attempts `i` and `i+1` is `i * retry_backoff_seconds`);
  `_sleep` is a module-level hook so tests patch it;
  attempts counted on `TaskRun`
- Concurrency caps: layered `asyncio.Semaphore`. Global
  semaphore sized from
  `POINTLESSQL_SCHEDULER_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS` (default 4)
  allocated on `Scheduler.start()`; per-job semaphores are
  lazy, keyed by `job_id`, sized from
  `Job.max_parallel_runs` (default 1). Global acquired
  before per-job (consistent lock order). DB `running`-count
  query stays as the authoritative `skipped` writer so
  process restarts don't lose state
- `logging_config.py`: new `job_run_id_var` and `task_id_var`
  alongside Sprint 16's `request_id_var`. `JSONFormatter`,
  `RequestIdFilter`, and the `LogRecord` factory carry all
  three. Scheduler sets them per-task and resets in
  `finally`. Sprint 19's `request_id_var = f"job-{job_run_id}"`
  is kept for continuity
- `log_job(job_run_id, task_id, level, message)` writes every
  status transition and retry to `job_logs`, synchronously
  relative to the task call
- `POST /api/jobs` accepts a DAG create form: `tasks` array
  with `{name, kind, config, depends_on, max_retries}`;
  validates cycles/unknown deps before insert
- New routes: `GET /api/jobs/{id}/tasks`,
  `GET /api/jobs/{id}/runs/{run_id}/tasks`,
  `GET /api/jobs/{id}/runs/{run_id}/logs?task_id=...`
- UI: "New DAG job" modal on `jobs.html` (JSON textarea — no
  builder yet). Per-task table on `job_detail.html` with
  status, retry count, last error; expandable Alpine log
  panel fetches lines on demand
- Settings: `POINTLESSQL_SCHEDULER_MAX_CONCURRENT_RUNS`
  (default `4`)
- `tests/test_scheduler_dag.py` — 13 new tests (topology,
  fail-skip, retry success, retry exhaustion, cycle
  detection, self-loop, unknown dep, per-job cap, global
  semaphore serialization, contextvars set/reset via
  caplog, `log_job` writer, route-level cycle 422). Sprint
  19's 23 scheduler tests and Sprint 16's 8 logging tests
  still green. Full suite not run in this sprint

### Added (Sprint 19)

- Alembic migration 005: `jobs` (name unique, cron_expr,
  run_as_user_id FK, kind, config JSON, is_paused, timestamps),
  `job_runs` with `(job_id, started_at DESC)` index, plus
  `job_tasks` and `job_logs` pre-created for Sprint 20
- `pointlessql/services/scheduler.py` — in-process asyncio
  scheduler started from `_lifespan`; `croniter`-driven due
  detection; per-tick running-run query prevents overlap;
  paused jobs skipped; failed `run_as_user_id` resolution
  surfaces as a `failed` run with a clear error
- Kind registry: `pg_sync` wraps Sprint 18 `run_sync` with
  `config["catalog_name"]`; `python` resolves an entry point
  from the `pointlessql.jobs` group (tests register a fake)
- Run-as-user builds `UnityCatalogClient.for_principal(user.email)`
  so soyuz's X-Principal applies automatically — reuses Sprint 7
- Scheduler sets `request_id_var` to `f"job-{job_run_id}"`
  inside each per-run span so structured logs correlate
  without a new contextvar (Sprint 20 adds
  `job_run_id_var` + `task_id_var`)
- Settings: `POINTLESSQL_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` (default `True`)
  and `POINTLESSQL_SCHEDULER_TICK_SECONDS` (default `30`)
- Routes: `GET /jobs` (list, ownership-filtered for non-admin),
  `GET /jobs/{id}`, `POST /api/jobs` (admin-only),
  `POST /api/jobs/{id}/run`, `POST /api/jobs/{id}/pause`,
  `POST /api/jobs/{id}/unpause` — all audited
- `frontend/templates/pages/jobs.html`,
  `frontend/templates/pages/job_detail.html` with "Run now" /
  "Pause/Resume" buttons visible to admin or the owner
- Navbar "Jobs" entry between "Notebook" and existing
  dropdowns
- `tests/test_scheduler.py` covering tick logic with a
  patched clock, state transitions, overlap prevention,
  paused skip, run-as-user principal forwarding, `pg_sync`
  end-to-end, route admin-gating and ownership filter

New dep: `croniter`.

### Changed (Sprint 19)

- `tests/conftest.py` sets
  `POINTLESSQL_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=false` before app import
  so the loop never ticks in ordinary test runs; the
  scheduler suite re-enables it per-test via monkeypatch
- `.gitignore`: `*.db-shm`, `*.db-wal` (SQLite WAL
  artifacts now produced by the scheduler's DB writes)

### Added (Sprint 18)

- `pointlessql/services/pg_sync.py`: pure-function Postgres → UC sync
  worker. `PG_TO_UC_TYPE` map, `map_pg_type_to_uc` with DECIMAL
  precision passthrough and STRING fallback on unknown types,
  `diff_snapshots(pg, uc_tables) -> SyncDiff` (schemas/tables/
  columns added/changed/dropped), `apply_diff` driving the facade,
  `PostgresIntrospector` protocol + `PsycopgIntrospector` default
  backed by `information_schema.columns` via `psycopg.sql.SQL`,
  `run_sync` glue that persists a `SyncRun` row per execution
- `unitycatalog.py` facade: `create_schema`, `create_table`,
  `delete_table` for driving the sync — all wrapped in
  `_wrap_catalog_errors`
- `POST /api/catalogs/{name}/sync` (admin-only, audited) resolves
  the catalog's bound Connection + optional Credential, builds a
  libpq DSN, runs the sync, and returns the `SyncRun` snapshot
- Alembic migration 004: `sync_run` table (`catalog_name`,
  `started_at`, `finished_at`, `status`, `added_count`,
  `changed_count`, `dropped_count`, `error`) with
  `(catalog_name, started_at DESC)` index
- `SyncRun` ORM model
- `components/sync_history_card.html`: last-20 sync runs + admin
  "Sync now" button on the foreign-catalog detail page
- Secret handling: connection options with keys matching
  `(?i)pass|secret|key|token` are overridden from a bound
  Credential's `additional_properties` (see `_effective_options`);
  missing Credential falls back to `options`
- 46 new tests (309 total) covering type mapping (16 parametrized),
  diff logic, secret merging, DSN builder, `apply_diff` with mock
  UC, `run_sync` end-to-end with stub introspector, the
  admin-only sync route, audit log emission, the history card
  render, and an `@pytest.mark.integration` test against a
  real Postgres container (documented, skipped by default)

### Added (Sprint 17)

- `unitycatalog.py` facade: `create_catalog(data)` and
  `delete_catalog(name, force)` wrapping the generated client's
  `_create_catalog` / `_delete_catalog`; both go through
  `_wrap_catalog_errors` so transport failures surface as
  `CatalogUnavailableError`
- `POST /api/catalogs` route (admin-only, audited) accepting the
  full `CreateCatalogRequest` shape — `name`, optional `comment`,
  `properties`, `type=FOREIGN`, `connection_name`, and free-form
  `options` passthrough — for wiring up foreign catalogs
- "Create foreign catalog" button + modal on the catalogs page
  (`pages/catalogs.html`): admin-only, pre-populated connection
  dropdown, key/value options row editor, posts through a new
  `createForeignCatalogForm(...)` Alpine factory in `federation.js`
- `components/foreign_catalog_card.html`: bound-connection link +
  inline options editor on the catalog detail page, rendered when
  `catalog.connection_name` is set
- FOREIGN badge on the catalog detail heading
  (`pages/schemas.html`) and in the sidebar tree
  (`components/sidebar.html`, `bi-plug` icon) so foreign catalogs
  are visually distinct from managed ones
- `optionsEditor(...)` in `properties_editor.js` — PATCHes
  `{ options: {...} }` to the catalog; shares a new
  `_makeDictEditor(field, ...)` helper with the existing
  `propertiesEditor`
- `tests/test_foreign_catalog.py` — 8 tests covering POST happy
  path + non-admin 403, PATCH options forwards dict verbatim,
  foreign-card/FOREIGN-badge/connection-link rendering, modal
  visibility for admin vs non-admin users
- `tests/test_federation.py`: new `TestCatalogsCreate` (4 tests)
  exercising the facade's managed + foreign-catalog create and
  delete paths (263 total pass)

### Changed (Sprint 17)

- `properties_editor.js`: `propertiesEditor` refactored to a
  shared `_makeDictEditor` helper; behavior preserved (the
  "cannot clear all properties at once" quirk stays scoped to
  `field === 'properties'`)
- `/` home handler fetches connections for the create modal only
  when the current user is admin (empty list otherwise, no
  `list_connections` call)

### Added (Sprint 16)

- `pointlessql/logging_config.py` — centralized logging: a
  `request_id_var` contextvar, `RequestIdFilter`, opt-in
  `JSONFormatter`, idempotent `configure_logging(level, fmt)`.
  Also installs a `logging.setLogRecordFactory` so every record
  is stamped with the current `request_id` (works with pytest's
  `caplog` without per-handler hookup)
- Settings: `log_level` (default `"INFO"`) and `log_format`
  (`"text"` | `"json"`, default `"text"`); env overrides
  `POINTLESSQL_LOG_LEVEL`, `POINTLESSQL_LOG_FORMAT`
- Module-level loggers in `api/main.py`, `api/error_handlers.py`,
  and `services/unitycatalog.py`
- Startup log line from `_lifespan` (host, port, engine,
  log_format)
- `error_handlers.py` warns on every handled `PointlessSQLError`
  except `AuthorizationError` (authz denials are expected
  traffic, not anomalies)
- `services/unitycatalog.py` `_wrap_catalog_errors` logs the
  original transport exception before re-raising as
  `CatalogUnavailableError` — fixes prior silent-swallow
- `tests/test_logging_config.py` — 8 new tests covering
  formatter, filter, idempotency, and end-to-end request-ID
  propagation through a captured warning log (251 total pass)

### Changed (Sprint 16)

- `request_id_middleware` sets the `request_id_var` contextvar
  (in addition to `request.state.request_id`) and resets it in
  `finally`, so every log record emitted during the request
  carries the ID — service-layer code no longer has to receive
  the `Request` object to log it
- `api/main.py` calls `configure_logging(...)` at module import
  time so uvicorn `--reload` workers and direct `uvicorn` invocations
  both pick up the configured format; idempotent, coexists with
  pytest's `caplog`

### Changed (Sprint 15)

- `[tool.pydoclint]` configuration in `pyproject.toml`: Google
  style, types in signatures only, `__init__` docs merged into
  class docstrings
- Ruff `D107` ignored — pydoclint owns `__init__` docstring
  policy via `allow-init-docstring = false`
- Merged `__init__` docstrings into class docstrings for `PQL`,
  `DuckDBEngine`, `UnityCatalogClient` (DOC301)
- Restructured exception docstrings: constructor params in Args,
  class-level annotations in Attributes (DOC602/603/101/103)
- Accurate Raises sections in `PQL.table`, `PQL.write_table`,
  `find_or_create_oidc_user` (DOC501/503)
- pydoclint: 0 violations across all 27 source files

### Added (Sprint 14)

- `pointlessql/api/error_handlers.py` — centralized FastAPI
  exception handler for `PointlessSQLError` family; dispatches
  JSON error envelope for `/api/...` routes and 403.html for
  HTML authorization errors
- Consistent JSON error envelope on all API error responses:
  `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "...", "request_id": "..."}}`
- Request-ID middleware: generates UUID4 per request (or
  forwards client `X-Request-ID`), attaches to error envelope
  and `X-Request-ID` response header
- `tests/test_error_handlers.py` — 13 new tests covering JSON
  envelope for each exception type, HTML 403 rendering,
  request-ID generation and forwarding, admin enforcement via
  centralized handler (243 total pass)

### Changed (Sprint 14)

- UC facade (`unitycatalog.py`): all public async methods
  wrapped with `_wrap_catalog_errors` decorator converting
  `httpx.HTTPError` / `UnexpectedStatus` →
  `CatalogUnavailableError` at the source — routes never see
  raw transport exceptions
- `_require_admin` raises `AuthorizationError` instead of
  returning a `JSONResponse`; `_deny_json`, `_deny_html`, and
  `_require_admin_html` removed
- ~40 duplicated try/except blocks removed from `main.py`
  (1164 → 815 lines); JSON API routes are now simple
  pass-through calls with exceptions propagating to the
  centralized handler
- HTML graceful-degradation routes (catalog/schema/table
  detail, federation pages) catch `CatalogUnavailableError`
  (domain exception) instead of raw `httpx.HTTPError`
- `httpx` and `UnexpectedStatus` no longer imported in
  `main.py`

### Added (Sprint 13)

- `pointlessql/exceptions.py` — domain exception hierarchy with
  `PointlessSQLError` base carrying `.status_code`, `.error_code`,
  `.detail`; six concrete types: `CatalogUnavailableError` (502),
  `CatalogNotFoundError` (404), `AuthenticationError` (401),
  `AuthorizationError` (403), `EngineError` (500),
  `ValidationError` (422, also inherits `ValueError`)
- `pointlessql/types.py` — `UserInfo` TypedDict replacing
  `dict[str, Any]` for authenticated user objects
- `tests/test_exceptions.py` — 17 new tests covering hierarchy,
  attributes, catchability, and backward compatibility
  (230 total pass)

### Changed (Sprint 13)

- Pyright: `typeCheckingMode` upgraded from `"standard"` to
  `"strict"` on source code; zero errors, 32 warnings (from
  incomplete third-party stubs)
- `AccessDenied` reparented as an alias for `AuthorizationError`
  in `services/authorization.py` (backward compatible)
- `OIDCError` reparented under `PointlessSQLError`
- PQL raises `CatalogUnavailableError` instead of `ConnectionError`,
  `CatalogNotFoundError` instead of `LookupError`,
  `ValidationError` instead of `ValueError`
- `make_engine()` raises `ValidationError` instead of `ValueError`
- `parse_full_name()` raises `ValidationError` instead of
  `ValueError`
- Broad exception catches narrowed: `except Exception` in
  `auth.py` → `except (ValueError, TypeError, PwdlibError)`,
  `except (JSONDecodeError, Exception)` in `oidc.py` →
  `except (JSONDecodeError, ValueError, UnicodeDecodeError)`
- `_STATE_COOKIE_NAME` in `oidc.py` renamed to `STATE_COOKIE_NAME`
  (was flagged by strict pyright as cross-module private access)
- `_get_user()` in `api/main.py` returns `UserInfo` instead of
  `dict[str, Any]`; `auth_middleware` and
  `_template_response_with_user` have explicit return type
  annotations

### Added (Sprint 12)

- `PolarsEngine` in `pointlessql/pql/engine.py` — reads Delta tables
  via PyArrow → `pl.from_arrow()`, returns `pl.DataFrame`; writes via
  `frame.to_arrow()` → `deltalake.write_deltalake()`
- `_POLARS_TYPE_MAP` + `_polars_type_to_uc()` for Polars dtype → UC
  type mapping
- `PolarsEngine` registered in engine factory and exported from
  `pql/__init__.py`
- Settings: `POINTLESSQL_ENGINE` now also accepts `"polars"`
- `POINTLESSQL_ENGINE` env var forwarded in `docker-compose.yml`
  (defaults to `"pandas"`)
- New dependency: `polars>=1.0`
- Engine compliance suite parameterized across all three engines;
  `TestPolarsEngineSpecific` with 3 Polars-specific tests; 2 new
  PQL constructor tests (9 new tests, 213 total pass)

### Added (Sprint 11)

- `pointlessql/pql/engine.py` — `Engine` protocol with `read()`,
  `write()`, and `columns_info()` methods; `PandasEngine` (default,
  preserving backward compatibility) and `DuckDBEngine` (reads Delta
  via PyArrow → DuckDB, returns `DuckDBPyRelation`)
- `make_engine()` factory to instantiate engines by name
- `columns_from_tuples()` in `_columns.py` — engine-agnostic column
  metadata builder for UC table registration
- Settings: `POINTLESSQL_ENGINE` (default `"pandas"`, also accepts
  `"duckdb"`) for engine selection via environment variable
- `PQL.__init__()` accepts `engine=` kwarg (string name or `Engine`
  instance); auto-selects from settings when omitted
- New dependencies: `duckdb>=1.0`, `pyarrow>=17.0`
- `tests/test_engine.py` — 20 new tests: parameterized engine
  protocol compliance suite (read, write, round-trip, column
  metadata) plus engine-specific tests for Pandas and DuckDB

### Changed (Sprint 11)

- `PQL.table()` and `PQL.write_table()` delegate all data I/O to
  the active engine instead of calling `deltalake` directly
- `PQL.__init__()` resolves `Settings` once and reuses it for both
  client creation and engine selection
- `columns_from_dataframe()` refactored to delegate to
  `columns_from_tuples()` internally (no behavior change)
- `pql/__init__.py` exports `Engine`, `PandasEngine`, `DuckDBEngine`,
  and `make_engine`

### Added (Sprint 10)

- `docker-compose.postgres.yml` — compose override that adds a
  Postgres service as PointlesSQL's metadata DB; usage:
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up`
- `.env.example` — documents all `POINTLESSQL_*` env vars with
  defaults and descriptions
- Settings: `POINTLESSQL_BASE_URL` for OIDC callback URIs behind
  reverse proxies or inside Docker (falls back to request-derived
  URI when unset)
- `psycopg[binary]>=3.1` promoted from dev to main dependencies
  so Postgres URLs work at runtime
- Test fixture: `TEST_DATABASE_URL` env var to run the test suite
  against Postgres (or any SQLAlchemy-supported backend)

### Changed (Sprint 10)

- OIDC redirect_uri construction uses `POINTLESSQL_BASE_URL` when
  set, fixing SSO flows behind reverse proxies and in Docker
- Test `_auth_db` fixture drops all tables on teardown for clean
  isolation on persistent backends (Postgres)

### Added (Sprint 9)

- `Dockerfile` — 3-stage multi-stage build (soyuz-client-builder →
  builder → runtime) using `python:3.14-slim` and `uv pip install`
- `Dockerfile.soyuz` — 2-stage build for soyuz-catalog
- `docker-compose.yml` — full-stack orchestration with health checks,
  shared `./warehouse` volume for Delta storage, `depends_on` with
  `service_healthy` condition, configurable host ports via env vars
- `.dockerignore` for clean Docker builds
- Settings: `POINTLESSQL_HOST` (default `127.0.0.1`) and
  `POINTLESSQL_PORT` (default `8000`) for configurable bind address
- Frontend path fallback: installed wheel resolves
  `pointlessql/_frontend` when dev `frontend/` directory is absent
- README: Docker quick-start section with `docker compose up --build`

### Changed (Sprint 9)

- `cli()` reads host and port from `Settings` instead of hardcoding
- Jupyter subprocess uses `--allow-root` and binds to `settings.host`
  for Docker compatibility

### Added (Sprint 8)

- OIDC / OAuth2 authorization-code flow with PKCE — opt-in via
  `POINTLESSQL_OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL` and `POINTLESSQL_OIDC_CLIENT_ID`
  env vars; supports both public and confidential clients
- `pointlessql/services/oidc.py` — PKCE generation, HMAC-signed
  state cookie, discovery document caching, token exchange, userinfo
  fetch, find-or-create user provisioning with same-email linking
- `GET /auth/sso` route initiates the OIDC flow; `GET /auth/callback`
  handles the provider redirect and auto-provisions local users
- Login page shows conditional "Sign in with SSO" button alongside
  the existing email/password form
- Alembic migration 003: `password_hash` nullable for OIDC-only
  users, `oidc_provider` + `oidc_subject` columns with partial
  unique index
- `tests/test_oidc.py` — 33 new tests (177 total pass)

### Changed (Sprint 8)

- `User.password_hash` is now nullable to support OIDC-only accounts
- `auth.login()` handles `password_hash=None` gracefully (OIDC-only
  users cannot log in via email/password, preserving constant-time
  comparison)

### Added (Sprint 7)

- Authorization enforcement layer: PointlesSQL now checks effective
  permissions from soyuz-catalog before each operation. Non-admin
  users need `USE CATALOG`, `USE SCHEMA`, `SELECT`, `MODIFY`, or
  `MANAGE_GRANTS` depending on the operation
- Per-request `X-Principal` header forwarding: every soyuz-catalog
  HTTP call includes the authenticated user's email as the
  `X-Principal` header (via per-request client factory)
- Admin bypass: users with `is_admin=True` skip all permission checks
- Federation routes (connections, external locations, credentials)
  restricted to admin users only
- 403 Forbidden error page with privilege details and "contact an
  administrator" hint (`pages/403.html`)
- Audit log: `audit_log` table (Alembic migration 002) records
  who-did-what for all write operations — updates, tag changes,
  permission grants/revokes, federation CRUD
- `pointlessql/services/authorization.py` — `check_privilege`,
  `check_privilege_from_effective`, `has_privilege`, `AccessDenied`
- `pointlessql/services/audit.py` — `log_action` for append-only
  audit entries
- Permissions UI enhancements: current user's row highlighted with
  "you" badge in both Assigned and Effective tabs; grant/revoke
  controls hidden when user lacks `MANAGE_GRANTS`
- Non-admin test user fixture (`non_admin_cookies`) in conftest
- `tests/test_authorization.py` — 15 unit tests for authorization
  service (admin bypass, privilege matching, dict privilege format)
- `tests/test_enforcement.py` — 21 route-level enforcement tests
  (allowed/denied/admin bypass for catalogs, schemas, tables,
  updates, permissions, federation admin-only)
- `tests/test_audit.py` — 3 audit log service tests

### Changed (Sprint 7)

- All API routes use per-request `UnityCatalogClient` via
  `_get_uc_client(request)` instead of the shared singleton
- Detail pages enforce access using already-fetched effective
  permissions (no duplicate HTTP call)
- `permissions_card.html` and `permissions_editor.js` accept
  `canManage` and `currentUserEmail` parameters
- `test_api_errors.py` updated for per-request client pattern
  (monkeypatches `UnityCatalogClient.for_principal`)

### Added (Sprint 6)

- Alembic + SQLAlchemy 2.0 for PointlesSQL's own metadata DB
- Local user registration and login with bcrypt password hashing
- JWT cookie-based auth (`pql_session`, HttpOnly, HS256)
- Login and register pages
- Auth middleware protecting all routes
- First-user admin bootstrap
- Navbar shows current user and logout button

### Added (Sprint 5)

- Tags editor card on catalog, schema, and table detail pages — add
  and remove tags via PATCH to soyuz-catalog's tags endpoint, with
  Alpine.js interactive component (`tags_editor.html`, `tags_editor.js`)
- Permissions card with two Bootstrap nav-tabs (Assigned / Effective)
  on all detail pages — grant privileges via principal + privilege
  selector, revoke by clicking badge; effective permissions loaded
  on-demand (`permissions_card.html`, `permissions_editor.js`)
- Lineage card on table detail page showing upstream and downstream
  dependencies as depth-indented node lists with clickable links to
  related tables (`lineage_card.html`)
- Lakehouse Federation: full CRUD pages for connections, external
  locations, and credentials — list pages with create modals, detail
  pages with inline comment editing and delete-with-confirmation
  (`connections.html`, `connection.html`, `external_locations.html`,
  `external_location.html`, `credentials.html`, `credential.html`,
  `federation.js`)
- Federation dropdown in navbar (Connections, External Locations,
  Credentials)
- 21 new async facade methods in `unitycatalog.py` (tags, permissions,
  effective permissions, lineage, connections CRUD, external locations
  CRUD, credentials CRUD)
- 25 new JSON API routes + 6 HTML page routes in `main.py`
- `tests/test_tags_permissions.py` — unit tests for tags, permissions,
  effective permissions, and lineage facade methods
- `tests/test_federation.py` — unit tests for connections, external
  locations, and credentials facade CRUD
- Extended `tests/test_api_errors.py` with 11 new error-handling tests
  for all new JSON API endpoints

### Changed (Sprint 5)

- Detail page route handlers (`catalog_detail`, `schema_detail`,
  `table_detail`) now fetch tags, permissions, and effective permissions
  in parallel via `asyncio.gather`; `table_detail` additionally fetches
  lineage. Failure in any single fetch does not break the page
- `base.html` loads three new JS files: `tags_editor.js`,
  `permissions_editor.js`, `federation.js`

### Added (Sprint 4)

- E2E smoke test (`tests/test_e2e.py`): full roundtrip — create
  catalog/schema, write table via PQL, verify in web UI with correct
  columns and PQL snippet card
- `tests/conftest.py` with shared integration fixtures (`soyuz_client`,
  `e2e_env`)
- `tests/test_api_errors.py` — unit tests for API error handling
  (all JSON endpoints return 502 when soyuz-catalog is unreachable)
- PQL snippet card with copy-to-clipboard button on table detail page
- Jupyter loading spinner on notebook page: polls `/api/jupyter/status`
  until ready, shows error state with retry button after 30 s timeout

### Changed (Sprint 4)

- API JSON endpoints (`/api/tree`, `/api/catalogs`, `/api/schemas`,
  `/api/tables`, PATCH endpoints) return HTTP 502 with JSON error body
  when soyuz-catalog is unreachable (previously returned 500)
- `PQL.table()` and `PQL.write_table()` raise `ConnectionError` with
  a user-friendly message when soyuz-catalog is unreachable (previously
  raised raw `httpx.ConnectError`)
- Notebook page uses Alpine.js polling to wait for Jupyter readiness
  before loading the iframe; shows "Jupyter Not Available" error state
  if startup fails
- README.md rewritten with MVP setup docs, quick start, PQL usage
  examples, configuration table
- CLAUDE.md updated with Phase 1 completion, PQL/Jupyter/Alpine.js
  in stack, expanded layout section

### Previously added (Sprint 3)

- `pointlessql/services/jupyter.py` — async context manager that
  starts JupyterLab as a managed subprocess (SIGTERM/SIGKILL
  lifecycle, health-check polling, configurable port)
- `GET /notebook` route with embedded JupyterLab iframe; sidebar
  remains visible alongside the notebook for catalog browsing
- `GET /api/jupyter/status` JSON endpoint for subprocess status
- "Notebook" tab in the navbar (`base.html`)
- `{% block content_class %}` in `base.html` for per-page layout
  overrides (used by notebook page to remove content padding)
- Settings: `jupyter_enabled: bool = True`,
  `jupyter_port: int = 8888` (env overrides:
  `POINTLESSQL_JUPYTER_ENABLED`, `POINTLESSQL_JUPYTER_PORT`)
- `notebooks/getting_started.ipynb` — starter notebook demonstrating
  `PQL` read/write/list workflows
- New dependency: `jupyterlab>=4.0`
- `tests/test_jupyter.py` — 11 unit tests covering subprocess
  manager, route handlers, status API, and settings defaults

### Previously added (Sprint 2)

- `pointlessql/pql/` package — sync bridge between UC metadata and
  Delta Lake DataFrames, designed for notebooks and scripts
- `PQL` class with `table()` (read Delta as DataFrame),
  `write_table()` (write DataFrame + register metadata), and
  `list_catalogs()` / `list_schemas()` / `list_tables()` convenience
  methods
- New dependencies: `deltalake>=0.24`, `pandas>=2.2`
- `tests/test_pql.py` — unit tests with mocked soyuz client
- `tests/test_pql_integration.py` — integration round-trip test
  (create → write → read → verify)
- `PQL` re-exported from `pointlessql` package root

### Previously added (Sprint 1)

- `pointlessql/settings.py` — pydantic-settings module with
  `soyuz_catalog_url` setting (env override: `POINTLESSQL_SOYUZ_CATALOG_URL`)
- `pointlessql/services/soyuz_client.py` — factory for a configured
  `soyuz_catalog_client.Client` instance
- `tests/test_soyuz_client.py` — integration smoke tests against a
  live soyuz-catalog server (`@pytest.mark.integration`)
- `soyuz-catalog-client` as editable path dependency

### Changed

- `pointlessql/services/unitycatalog.py` — rewritten to delegate to
  the generated soyuz-catalog client instead of hand-rolled httpx
  calls. All methods convert attrs response objects to plain dicts
  via `.to_dict()` so templates stay unchanged
- `pointlessql/api/main.py` — lifespan uses `make_soyuz_client()`
  factory; error handling catches `UnexpectedStatus` alongside
  `httpx.HTTPError`

### Fixed

- Fixed code-gen bug in soyuz-catalog-client: `list_tables`
  `_parse_response` now handles the 200 status and returns
  `ListTablesResponse` instead of treating success as an unexpected
  status
